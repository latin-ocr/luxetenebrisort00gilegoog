philosopher, the educator, and the statesmon to enter upon and

Ι work, with certainty, in the end, ol success. li the human

mind contained any element which was sels-originating
spontaneous‚ and not to be calculated upon, then all effort to
benefit and advance mankind would be useless, and hope
would indeed be blotted out of the page of human history.
But if the doctrine oi necessity, of cause and effect, and ol
phenomena depending on lawa be admitted into psychical as
well as into physical affairs, then it will follow that by the
inductive methodos reasoning such laws may be discovered:
and psychology‚ this principle accepted, becomes one of the
inductiva sciences.

This doctrine of necessity, fate, predestination, seems on
reflection so conclusive, so consistent—not only with the facts
around us, but with the words in everyday use-that it
might appear strange that it has never yet been generally
accepted. But many causes have been in operation to produce
this. In the first place, the generality of persons do not reflect
on the subject at all, but arc content with superficial impres-
sions 3 and they say that the doctrine is opposed to common
sense. And it must be admitted that it is so in fact, if by
common sense is meant that which is obvious to the common
vision-to the first impressione of every eye. The motives
which cause the will to act, lor the most part, operate uncon·
sciously and out ol sight, and conduct cannot be traced to
them without much skill in analysis3 and thus the psyche
appears to the common observer to put forth its will spon-
taneously. ln being opposed to first impressione, and therefore
to the opinion of the great majority of mankind, who are led
by first impressions„this doctrine is in the same position as all
great scientific laws. They are all, at first sight, opposed to
common sense. Το the common eye—·viewing the superficial
phenomena only-the sun appears to go round the earth:
vision ol aless common order-disceming more profoundly
and extensively-perccives that the earth goes round the sun.
