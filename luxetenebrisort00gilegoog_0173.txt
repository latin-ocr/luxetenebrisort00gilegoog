. of misconstruction 3 vanity—the pleasure of hoinga
mystery 3—any or all of these causes combined may
present obstacles to a proper understanding. It
results, then, that there exist two classes of
character: one open, clear, transparent ;-it may be
’ shallow, light, weak3—but genial, bright‚ sparhling 3
or it may be also profound, rich, capacious ; reflect-
ing from its generous depths all the wealth it has
received from without 3—the other aelf-contained,
dark, impenetrable3 presenting no indicatione, save
to the adept, of its interior 3 whether dull, irrespon-
sive clod throughout, or pregnant with concentrated
wealth capable of enriching all capable of exploring
its depths. Each character has its advantages and
drawbacks. The open and confiding one is constantly
misconstrued and betrayed. It is the sport of fools
and the dupe of lrnaves: but, on the other hand, it
is by far the most generally popular. Confidence
begets confidence3 distrust, distrust. The man who
-to use the ordinary phraseology—admits other
persons freely into his mind is, in turn, admitted
freely into the minds of others3 while the close and
reserved character must of necessity enjoy inter·
course with but a few, and is equally, perhaps more
than equally, liable to misapprehension. Excess on
either side amounts, perhaps, to a fault. Every
mind, conscious of good intentione and free from
pride or vanity, has a natural desire to be understood.
Itis its desire and also its interest. But to secure
this object, a due regard must be had to the compre-
hending powers and worth of the persons with whom
it has intercourse and to whom it opens itself.
