And as the sciences emerge out of the intellectual
chaos, the arts emerge'with them, and in the same
order. As longas any science exista in the confused
and conjectural stage, the art which is dependent on
it is empirical and liable to error; hut as soon aa
the laws which regulata its subject-matter are dis-
cerned, then such laws are applied to the art which
is its outcome, and there is introduced into such art
calculation and certainty. In proportion aa the
theory or mental view, therefore, of any department
of science is correct or inaccurate, in the same
proportion must the results of such theory when
applied to practice be good or unsatisfactory. The
Α truth of such proposition is obvious, and it is abun-
dantly borne out by facts. In most of the physical
sciences much certain knowledge exista, a number of
facts having been collected, and, out of these, general
facts or principles educed ; and as a consequence, the
physical arts are as a fact worked with considerable
success. In every department of nature wherein no
psychical clement exists the triumphs of man are
great, and he is able to a great extent to adapt them
to his wishes. But whenever the psychica] enters

treats of the functione of the human body-Physiology
