minds, consciously or unconsciously, as new ideas
enter3 and thus the mind is not overwhelmed hythe
infinite number of physioal things which surround
it, and with which through its perceptive faculty it
comes in contact3 but the more rapidly right percep-
tions of such things enter, the more distinctly is the
truth which lies in such things perceived, and the
more rapidly does the growth of physical soience-the
expression of physical truth in the mind-proceed
And the same law holds good respecting the sorece
which exist, and which produce casote. Having in
the manner described (ξ XXII.) gained notions of
the different physical forces, we compare these also
together, and discover in them resemblances and
differences, and classify them also, rising higher and
higher from the less to the more general, until we
attain to the conception of one common and universal
force, diffused through and pervading all matter, of
which common force all the particular ones that we
are cognisant of are pheses or modificatione, accord·
ing to the circumstances under which each acts.
And just as in the system of things we discover a
plan, capable of being understood by the reason,
and of serving as aguide to us when so understood3
so, in the system of forces, we find regular and
unchanging laws, capable of being measured and
calculated upon 3 so that hythe aid of such laws,
when understood, under any given condition the
results may be predicted. And if in the physical
system of the universe we are unable to see oley
such results should flow from such causes, and such
