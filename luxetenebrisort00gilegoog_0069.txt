the hrain which supplies the material instruments
through which it operatas. Now it is to maintain
the incessant dynamio action thus going on in the
hrain in connection with the mental operatione, aad
to repair the waste caused thereby, that the fcod of
the human body is mainly applied. Compared with
what is required for this purpose, that portion of the
focd prepared by the assimilative organs which is
appropriated for their own wants and for those
cf other organs not concerned in producing mental
phenomeua, is altogether insignificant. Nutrition,
which is an end in the vegetable and lower
animal, is a means in man. We eat to live, not
live to eat. Our life is mental, not vegetable.

The crowning point, then, of the human body,
that for which all the cther parts exist and to which
they are tending, is the brain—the material condition
cf both physical and psychical conscicusness. And
thus from the inorganic kingdom—from the dust of
the earth-a structure is reared in which matter and

mind come into contact and blend, and there is

‘⁴ One first matter all,

Endued with various forms, warious dagrees
Of structura, and, in things that live, of life ε

, But mora refined, more spirituous and pure,
As nearer to Him placed or nearer tending,
Each in their several 'active spheres assigned,
'Till body up tc spirit work, in bounds
Propertioned to its kind. Sc, from the root
Springs lighter the green stalli, from thence the leaves
More aery, last the bright consummate flowers,
Spirits odorous breathes ; flcwars and their fruits,
Man’s nourishmcnt, by gradual scala sublimed,
Το Vital spirits aspira, tc Animal,
To Intellectual.”
