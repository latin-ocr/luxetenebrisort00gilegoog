other hand, should they be found, while harmonising
well with all established truth and existing good, to
increase our stock of such, they should be accepted.
They will have justified themselves by their fruits.

Art is the outcome of science. Out of notions of
reality we form conceptione of possible good, and
these conceptione we seek 10 realise by art. 'ibe
quality of our art, therefore, is regulated primarily
’by that 01 our knowledge. The greater our know-
ledge, the more abundant is our material for art.
The more accurate our knowledge, the more correct
is our art. Art and knowledge 01 sciense, therefore,
havea direct relation 1ο each other. Nature is a
unity, sciense is our knowledge or mental conception
of this unity. It is therefore one3 but it is divided
into the several departments which constitute ‘The
Sciences' to adapt it to our limited faculties, which
can only view it in detail.

Our first notions 01 everything are confused and
indistinct-a mental chaos, out of which, as our ideas
become clear and distinct, the sciences emerge. And

the law which regulates the order of their emergence .

is that the greater the complexity of the subject·
matter 01 each, the later is the date of its appearance.
Our knowledge depende on our faculty of distinguish-
ing. To know and comprehend thoroughly a thing,
we must know and comprehend all its parts3 and todo
this, it is necessary that it should be taken to pieces .
by 0 process of mental dissection, and that each of
its parts should be viewed separately. It follows
from this that the simplest things are understood first3

then, as each of these becomes known, one step is
