the body. As when the impression has been of
such a nature as to disorganise the structure in
which such nerves are distributed, or by its violence
or long continuance to exhaust or impair the fonction
of the organ of sense, or of its sensory ganglia: in
such cases the organio sensibility is roused and
corporeal sensatione are excited. These subjective
phenomena are in every case probably produced
through the agency of a special system of nerves
which, distributed throughout the body, telegraph to
the hrain, and thence to the mind, all corporeal
affections of any importance, whether agreeable or
disagreeable, occurring in structures with which they
are connected. And it is further noteworthy that
in proportion that subjective phenomena, whether
sensuous or corporeal, are excited in consciousness

by an impressing thing, in the same proportior does

sometimes to be altogether lost 3 every kind of conÎ‡
sciousness being absorbed in that of feeling.

External impressione then, to attract notice, must
either suggest ideas or excite sensuous or corporeal
feelings in the mind.

And this no doubt is pretty nearly the actual condition which

trace of cerebral hemispheres, and whose cerebral organa comprise
little or nothing higher than sensory ganglia and their appendages.
Such have neither ideas, memory, thought, or will3 and their
consciousness is necessarily limited to thot of 'the things actually
