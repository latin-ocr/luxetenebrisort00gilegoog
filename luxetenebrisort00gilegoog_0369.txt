necessary for art. The heart of the age, in the absence
of this higher knowledge and higher art, is necessarily
set on the only good of which it has a complete con-
ception-the sensuous. This, their highest ideal, the
messes seek openly by any road—per fos out ecfos—
and although there are not wanting minds in which,
either through innato happy perceptive faculty or
favourable circumstances, higher wants have been
created, yet such wants romain unsupplied. In the
dark uncertainties which surround them they can
perceive neither what will satisfy themselves or oon·
vince others.

Nor need this condition of things cause any dis-
quietude. If the views that have been put forth
respecting the soul and the laws of its development,
the intellectual progress of society, and the effect of
such progress on the spiritual conception be correct,
such temporary eclipse of the source of light must ’
of necessity occur at certain periods incur intel-
lectual, as in our physical sky. And the same motor
forces which have brought us to this period will carry
us through. We shall emerge with truer conceptione
respecting ourselves and our destinies, and the laws
which bind us to the things around us and to the
universe in which we move. With the return of
light the social discord which, engcndered by dark-
ness, prevails universally, will cease. Men will no
longer be divided into two hostile and conflicting
parties, animated by antagonistic motives, each of
which would be, in excess, alilre destructive to the
social organism-—the one by consuming its struc-

ture, the other by chilling its vitality. (Note R.)
