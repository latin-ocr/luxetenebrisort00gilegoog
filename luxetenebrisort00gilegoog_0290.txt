and elevated to its full height, require forits support
a creed or spiritual conception broader and of larger
dimensions than that which sufficed for the narrow
and limited ideas of its infancy. ¹

The creed, then, of its early infancy is necessarily
unable to support the more mature psyche under
adversity. In such creed it perceives at once that
many things are based on erroneous notions, and
that a large proportion had no basis whatever in fact3
and that of the whole amount, only a comparatively
few on investigation remain undisturbed and reliable.
But for the soul to he safe it is necessary that what
supports it should rest on the absolute and unchange-
able. If it rest on anything but truth—on any
conjecture or temporary prop based not on solid,
immutable fact, buton fallacy—then such prop will
sooner or later give way. As soon as the adverse
facts appear, the fallacy will be dissipated. The
creed‚ being unsounded in fact, will be no longer trust-
worthy. Under the pressure of adversity it will break
down, and the psyche be prostrated and helpless.

That the soul may be persectly safe under all cir-
cumstances, it is necessary then thata due proportion
exist between its perceptions and its conceptions-
that its conceptions of the spiritual and unknown
correspond with its perceptione of the actual and
known. And, to preserve this proportion, it must
be vigilant to observo the facts as they come into
view, and to supply the deficiencies in its creed by
broader and more certain conceptions. If this atti-
tude be maintained, it will be preserved from
surprise, and overoome by no sudden blow.
