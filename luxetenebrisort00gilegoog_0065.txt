thought, but of the absolute nature of which we are
and must romain equally ignorant3 since no sense
exists by which they can be presented directly in
consciousness. All that we are cognisant of is the
phenomena which their mutual action 011 each other
occasione, and, by reasoning on these phenomena,
we infer that the one, in the form of brain, is the
common source of the forces by which such pheno·
mena are generated, and the other the common
receptacle in which they are comprehended or
contained. And thus, on the very threshold of
inquiry, we are taught the important lesson, which
every step of advance confirma, that we are quite
unable to conceive the absolute nature of any one
thing 3 but that all our knowledge is phenomena]
only. All we know on this subject of matter and
mind· is, that there is on the one hand the highest
material product, brain3 and on the other, mind3
and that these two are co-related. That whenever
the former exista, rightly organised and supplied
with the conditions requisite for the performance of
its fonctions, the latter exista also. That whenever
the fonctions of the material organ are0interfered
with, the phenomena of the mental factor are
deranged ; and that, if the functione of the material
factor are suspended or destroyed, the phenomena
presented by the mental factor cease also.

The ancient controversy respecting the nature of mind, whether
material or immaten'al, has in modern times, until recently, been
permitted to sleep ; a condition which many causes have con·
