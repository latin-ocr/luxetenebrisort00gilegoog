§ XXIX It being premised, then, that the whole of
the psychical revelation is made through the organic

sense, and that the first thing presented in the order
of time is the consciousness of corporeal existence,
we proceed to consider how this presentation takes
place. The human ¹body, forming part of the physical
world, is, like every other part of that world, the
seat of change constantly going on. Forces are
acting on and passing through it, and events are
happening in it. These processes arc performed in
all the more complex animal organisms through the
intervention of nerves and ganglia, hut as these
ganglia are not situated in the hrain, but are dis-
‘persed throughout the body, no direct consciousness
is usually excited in the mind by their action, and
the changes which they effect are for the most part
unperceired therein. But this is hy no means always
the case. The function of many important organs
are never performed without phenomena entering the
mental sphere and being experienced as sensations
¹by the psyche3 and these psychical phenomena, like
the physical which have entered through the externa]
sensas, are either agreeahle or disagreeable, accord-
ing as the action set up in the bodily organs is
harmonicus or discordant with their structure3 free
or impeded 3 and according as the nervous tension of
the ganglia concerned is high or feeble. Moreover‚
:even in those cases where the function is habitually
performed nnconsciously, when such function is
cnduly excited or impeded, or the organic structure
strained or damaged, sensations are excited In this
