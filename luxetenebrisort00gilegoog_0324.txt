stronger than any other, and support us under and
enable us to sustain every calamity. From the
influence of this—the highest sentiment of our
nature-nothing can release us. Philosopher and
bigot alike are in their last resort driven to their
creeds3 the only difference being that vvhile the
creed of the philosopher offers its support uncon·
ditionally and leaves him his liberty, with the free
use of his faculties,—that of the bigot stipulates as
the preliminary condition of its support, the absolute
surrender of freedom. With eyes blinded and limbs
fettered, he is held to his creed by the bonds of

authority, and so is only preserved from other
⁸ tyrannies by the subjugation of his soul to the
greatest one of all. Nor can it be said that this
matter of freedom is one of minor importance, and
that it signifies little how rectitudo is preserved as
long as it is preserved It signifies much; it signifies
all: it signifies the whole difference between psychical
development and psychical degeneration. Truth is
mental food. By means of it the soul is nourished.
As it enters, the mind expands and the psyche is
developed in the same proportion. And vvith the
mental expansion and elevation, the creed of the free
inquiror also rises and expande: and although during

the transitional periods‚ while the creed is being
adjusted to the nevv views, the psyche may be for a
time inadequately supported, yet this period of un-
certainty is only temporary, and may be not unsalutary.
On the other hand, in the darlrened mind of the bigot,
held fast by his creed, no intellectual progress is
permitted, and no psychical development possible.
