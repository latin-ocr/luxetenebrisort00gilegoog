ξ XLIX. For the psyche, then, 10 put forth its
will-force, the presence cf a motivo is necessary.
And such motive must belong to one 01 1110
classes z-it must either proceed from the desire to
obtain from outside things the realisation 01 801110

preserve sels-respect. Now the motives present to
consciousness at any given time depend on the
position in which such person is placed at that time
with relation to outside things3 on 1118 perceptive
powers, and the 110110118- and conceptions in his

depends on his mental habit, his moral training.
And 01 these three conditions—capacity, instruction,
and training-the last 18 by far· the most important.

Great natural capacity and copious information only ¹
