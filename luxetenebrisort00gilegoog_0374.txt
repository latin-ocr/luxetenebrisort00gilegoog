also tenches that both objecta of sense and psyche are aliha

and the two schools of thought, idealism and realism, are

physical end social organisms the hypothesis of a mind-cell
would seem well to harmonise. ·
To be in a position to judge whether this hypothesis of a
mind-cell has any practical velue, the reader should be in
