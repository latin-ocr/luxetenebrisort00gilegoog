1116 scientific necessitorian, then, from the unity of
plan which he perceives in the Oosmos, from the
unity of force to which 111 events can be traced, and
from the unity of purpose to which they all seem to
be tending, is compelled by the mental law which
renders him unable to form 1 notion ofploo without
the conception of 1 contriving Intelligence—offorec,
without the conception of a mentul Source—or of
purpose, without that of 1 maintaining Will,-to infer
the existence of 1 universal Mind as the great First,
Oause of everything. Such 1 Mind, conoeiving all
things, must be ull-comprehensive, omniscicot ; being
the source of ull force, it must be omnipotent3 and
the aim and purpose of 111 such forces being, oc-
hypothesi, in the direction of perfect good, it must be
old-benevolcot. And his saith in these conclusions
will be in exact proportion to his faith in their pre-
mises. If he is certain of these latter, he is certain
also of the former, and rests securely on such support.
And as such certain knowledge enters his mind, all
preconceived notions inconsistent therewith 116 dis-
sipated, und 111 false theory vanishes. The notion
of 1 vengeful, cursing Creator, punishing a wretched
helpless creature, disappears ot once 3 together with
all the unheolthy fancies it has engendered. And,
with these unfounded beliefs, vanish also the diffi-
culties which beset the theologion, who feels himself
bound-by the bonds of authority—to such false
theory. 'lhe necessitarien, whose mind science has
rendered free, con therefore reconcile in his spiritual
conception the doctrines of all-knowledge and ull·
goodness without doing violence to the laws of logio 3
