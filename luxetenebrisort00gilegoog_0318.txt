which represent it in consciousness, and of which we
have direct perception. Nor is the nature of the
connection between the mind-cell and the screbat
matter in which it exists better understood. We
know that impressione, derived from outward things,
are made on the orgaus of sense with which they are
either directly or indirectly in contact ; that nerve-
currents, called thereby into action, traversa the nerves
of these organs, aud telegraph these impressions to
the brain3 that hrain-action is thereby set up, and
hrain-forces generated; and that these hrain-forces
play, so to speak, on the mind-cell, and, flushing into
its interior, register therein the impressions thathave
been so transmitted, in characters which seem to be
formed out of substance supplied by the mind-cell
itself. We know, also, that what are called subjective
phenomena-the sensations and feelings to which the
psyche itself is subject-are produced in a similar
way by hrain-forces, and as these subjective phenomena
are caused hythe objective, we know also that there
must be communication between the portions of brain
which give rise to the subjective and those which are
the source of the objective phenomena, though our
present knowledge of cerebral physiology is inadequate
to demonstrate either the seat of the organs or the
nature of the connection. Further, we know that
these two classes of events-braiu·action and mind-
action—are inseparably associated and corelated ;
hrain-action never occurring outside the mental
sphere without mental phenomenn presenting them·
selves within, and mental phenomena never being

perceived within unless hrain-action is going on out·
