INTRODUCTION. 21

use. By persons belonging to this party, the present
work will be fairly and candidly judged. To them
the author would say, addressing them in the words
of Petraroh,—“ 1, in truth‚ do not seek so much to
impose a law on others, as to explain the law of my
own mind3 which let whoever may approve thereos,
abide by; let him who may not approve, reject.''

To many of them it may oontain no new truth ;

and from such, all he asks is to deal leniently with '

its imperfectione for the sake of its intentions: but
he has reason to think that to some the method
of investigation at least may be of use3 that it may
assist them by pointing in the direction in which
they are to traval-perhaps helping them a little on
the road.

But in any case, whatever may be the fate of
his work, the author will never regret the time and
labour he has spent on its production. It owes him
nothing. Let immature and sickly poets senti-
mentalise about the ohilling and disenohanting
effeots of “oold philosophy: ” he has experienoed
none of such. It has aowooea sor him ao raz'nboos,
alaprped ao aayela' triopa· and, if it has dispelled
any illusione, they have been mostly of the hob-
goblin kind. It has brought far more than it has
taken away. It has heguiled many a dull honr,
soothed many an anxious one: and he parts with it
now as he would from an old friend with whom he
had passed many years of his life. (See Note O,
Appendix.)
