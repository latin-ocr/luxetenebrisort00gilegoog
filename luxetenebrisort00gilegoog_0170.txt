another man into his own. No one psyche can
disclose itself by direct revelation to another. Neither
the mind of another, nor any of its contente, whether
intellectae] or sensory, can be direotly perceived by
any one. That both of these classes of phenomena,
the intellectual and the sensory, are contained in

when it was shown that the latter have the same
relation to the sensory ganglia of the brein that the
former have to its intellectual ganglia: both being
alilre the expression of organic physioal action. But
it may be shown, not only that these two classes of
phenomena, the sensory and the intellectual, are not
identioal in different minds‚ but that they necessarily
vary in each case. With respect to our sensory per-
ceptions, these can never precisely resemble each
other in two different persons at the same moment
of time, for no two persons can at the same moment
of time be oocupying the same stand-point3 and even
were it otherwise, both the sensory ganglia in which
the final physical change in the organ concerned in
perception occurs, and the avenues of sense in which
it is initiated, would have to be exaotly similar in
every respect in the two persons in question for the
phenomena to resemble exaotly—-outward conditions
remaining the same. And if thisbe true of sensory
perceptions, still more is it true of intellectual.
For these to resemble-ssfor the ideas hived up in
