existis thebrain. They contend, therefore, that the perceivsd
phenomena are altogether mental-residing, like ideas, not in
the brein, nor in the outside world, bnt in the mind Το this
the realists retort‚ with apparent truth, that they cannot be
in the mind of the conscious being, since they are represented
in consciousness as outside not only such being but the body
in which it is incorporated. Thus the opposing parties wege
awar of mutual destruction; reason and common sense are
at rariance 3 and a philosophical dead-look is occasioned
tending to universal scepticism. This dead-loch the hypo-
thesis of the mind-cell, by introducing a distinction between
the mind and the conscious being, relieves; and reconciles the
views of the contending parties. By representing the perceived
objects as outside the psyche, it satisfies the realist; and by
representing both objects and psyche as within the mind, it
satisfies the idealist; and further, by supplying a datum
for the existence of a psyche, it furnishes a ground for
opposition to the doctrine of materialism with all its desolating
consequences, and takes away from psychology the reproach
that itis a science without a subject.

Fitting therefore, as the author contenda, all the facts of
the cese, it fulfils ell the conditione which are required of an
hypothesis, and claims therefore, as long as it does so, to be
admitted as such—at any rate, until a fitter appear. That by
it the mystery oi perception is unravelled at once, is not
supposed. Itis at best buta step on the threshold of
psychology, supplying ground for further advance If itis
unsound, let it be refuted; but let it be remembered that
ridicule is not refutation. The days are past when
