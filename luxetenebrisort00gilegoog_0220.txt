accomplished, and it arrives at the eud with an
accession of health and spirits from an exercise which
would, without the aid of these diverting objects,
have been irlrsome and insipid. The comparisou

child does not merely pursue butterflies and herculeas
objects ou the road, but strays often off the road
after'will-of-thewisps and into bogs and quagmires,

usually it is 'not until the walk has come almost
to an end and all its happiness is marred, that it
learns to consult the guide. Moreover it suffers
injuries in its walk, when on the right path, from
other children, against whom its guide cannot pro·

life must be learnt by experience only: no other
school can teach what life is. Yet there is no reason .
why the elements of natural moral law might not
be taught as those of physical science. The child ’
might be taught to have recourse to his guide
habitually before, instead of after, committing him-
self to his object, or, dropping the metaphor, might
be trained to attend habitually to the things and
persons around him; to inquire before doing a thing
