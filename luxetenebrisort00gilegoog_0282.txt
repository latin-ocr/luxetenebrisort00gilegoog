and euch as these, we 10010 0100 this: that there
must be 101 011 these cases 0 101010, 01 God is not
good. The 100000 derived from our persona-l con-

sciousness that we are individually and psychically
indivisible, and therefore, in accordance with physical
analogy, indestructible and immortal, 10 corroborated
by our moral reason. Either there must be 0 101010
101 every 000, and what is hid from us is good, 01
0100 the Omnipotent Creator, 10 endowing such beings
with 1110, has inflicted on them intolerable wrong.
But the latter alternative must be rejected, being
both abhorrent to our feelings and 0110110000 with
011 the facts of our moral nature. We are therefore
bound by the strongest law 01 001 001010, 001 00000 01
right, to believe in immortality. There 10 no scien· .
tific truth more certain than this3 since a deduction
from moral 10010 10 quite 00 0011010 as any deduction
from physical 10010 000 be. The existence, then, 01
wrong-of suffering acting without producing evident
good fruit, 00 10 the instances given above—requires for
110 justification, and compels our belief in, the, exist·
0000 01 0 11111110 state. And if to such conclusion
we are impelled by the 10010 given above, in which
the suffering which is exhibited would be pu1pose-
less on any other view, still more strongly 010 110
forced to it by that other class 01 10010 where suffer·
ing in the form 01 0011001100 01 01100110001001 10 with-
held when due—when men die, steeped to 0010101100
10 every vice and blackened by every 011010; with
consciences callous, hecrts untouched, and every desire
apparently gratified,

“ With 011 their imperfectione on their heads.'’
