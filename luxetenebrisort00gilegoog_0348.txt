kind3 all our knowledge consisting of a confused
mass of undigested facts in which no plan or order
is discernible. Having therefore no rules to go by,
we are neither able to regulata our minds with any

certainty so as 10 prevent disorder therein, nor to
rectify such when it has arisen. And from this
defective condition of our cerebral and mental know·

psychology are perfected will that great desideratum,
the sound mind in the sound body, be secured.

And 11 our psychology is imperfect from our
defective cerebral physiology, our Sociolopy 10 01111 -

11 may seem, without a knowledge 01 the physical
body in which the psyche is framed, and by and
through which its mind is informed and its conduct
determined, it is impossible that the social body, of
which each psyche is an unit, can be understood.
And sociology being on this account in a chaotic
condition, of necessity Politice-the art which comes
out of it-is also confused and blundering3 so that
no certain statesmanship existe, but even the most
advanced societies are divided into adverse and con-

rule 01 right, but governed by their own interests
and feelings, and aiming at totally opposite objects,

which each equally thinks is 101 the good of the “

society3 and secking to obtain such objecta by any
