further, experience also tells us that no modification
of, or change in, consciousness can occur-whether
such change be affected by the action oi surrounding
things on the conscions being, mind being the passive

of consciousnese being associated with material change
in the nerva-matter. Lastly, a further investigation
of the phenomena informs us that this connection
of consciousness with neree-matter does not exist
throughout the entire nervous system, but occurs
only in those central messes of news-matter, or
ganglia, which collectively constitute the braia

physical change and organic action taking place
within the body itself, do not as such enter into the

the several organs of sense give rise to currente
