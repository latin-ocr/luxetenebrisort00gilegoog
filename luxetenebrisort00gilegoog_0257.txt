scientific revelation. It gave the world no new
intellectual truths, physical or psychical. Nor did
it destroy intellectual error which it found. It left

birth to. But it added to the old spiritual con·
ception, conspicuously emblazoned thereon, this one
statement: “ God is love.” On the old garment it

fieroe and conducted with such weapons as 1ο amply
justify the melancholy prediction of the Great
Teacher‚ that He “ came not to send peace on earth,
