Man is connected with both of the worlds into which
’ the cosmos is divided—the physical and the psychical;
his body forming a part of the one, his mind of the
other. With each of them he has relations, and
towards each he has duties. The parts of each with
which he is connected constitute his circumstances,
and on right relations between them and him being
established and maintained, and on their right
relations with each other, both his and their well
being, and that of the cosmos as awhole, depends.
In the psychica] world, as in the physical, changes
are constantly going on, and the relations of the
parts to each other are perpetually altering, and
therefore constant attention is due from every man
to his circumstances to understand and adopt him-
self to such changes and to fulfil the duty of the
hour. The mental attitnde which it is necessary to
assume in order to discharge this duty has been
fully described when treating of the relations of the
mind to its physioal circumstances, and need not
therefore be dwelt upon again. Itis enough to say
that the same attitnde in every particular is requisite
towards the psychioal surroundings. In the circum-
stances which the cosmos presents, and not iu the
imaginations of the heart, is contained the rule of
duty. Itis a man's duty to confront his surround-
ings, to give to each the attention which 13 their ·
due, and, applying to them his intellectual and con-
ceptual faculties, to gather their import and choose
by the light of reason the best course to pursue.
Such course constitutes his path of right, and he

may not follow any object on which 1113 heart is set
