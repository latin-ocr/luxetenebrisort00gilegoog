30 Loxa verereris,

some of the features being left out and others ¹
appearing different from the actual fact, then araneosa
conclusione will be formed. Or, lying within the
range of clear vision, they may be misunderstood
from carelessness ,· or, although obvious, be unat·
tended to through acyliyenoe. Or, lastly, there ia
the case in which the eye of the observer has been
unduly attracted—fascinated perhaps—by some ob-
ject or set of objects3 so that others have been
altogether excluded from view, or at least have not
received their due share of attention. This class of
- persons includes both the dreamer with eye fixed on
some distant and lofty object—perhaps in the
clouds, and the low-minded man, who minda only
earthly things. Such men eall not—and sometimes,
enslaved by habit, cannot-use their reason. They
both of them fail in their judgments through folly3
and the low-minded man is base as well.

Using the reason, then, means applying the
mental eye to the lacteos our consciousness: and
the conditions which interfere with its successful
action are ignorance, carelessness, and wilfulness
Our “sins, negligendas, andignoranoes,” arethe
true source of all our errors and miseries 3 and as we
have itin our power to avoid the first two of these,
we are for them personally responsible. The causes
which produce them—at least the proximante causes
-lie in our own persons, and not in circumstances.

§XIL The duty of a man therefore, whether in
hunting for truth or in seeking to act rightly, is to
give the facts of his consciousness due attention,
and to form his opinions and gulde his conduct
