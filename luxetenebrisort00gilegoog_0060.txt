changes (chemical, electric, or sui pencris) which, by
a mysterious process altogether inscrutable and in·
conceivable to our minda, are perceived as phenomena
within that sphere, being therein translated into
colours, sounds, tastes, smells, and the various modi·
fications of touch and of organic sensation,—in
short, into all that forms the elementary facts of our
consciousness.

ξ XVI. That the material seat of all our sensa-
tions and perceptione is in the brain (including in
that word the sensory ganglia), not in the organs of
sense, is one of the most certain of physiological
trutha Excitement of the sensory ganglia—either

by the action of medicina] agents or by pathological
hodily conditions—will give rise in consciousness to
phenomena similar in every respect to those produced

by impressions from things outside the body, even
when no such impressions are received through the
organs of sense 3 and conversely—if the medium of
communication between the sensory ganglion and its
organ of sense be cut off, an impression on such ’
organ will not he perceived, nor give rise to any ·

dreams‚ delirium, hallucinations or illusions of the
