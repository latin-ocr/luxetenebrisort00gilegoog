to relieve the memory. Such systema are at first
necessarily imperfect As long as the facts of any
department of knowledge are imperfectly perceived,
true classification is impossible. Phenomena which
lie on the surfaoe presenting themselves first, things
are necessarily at first associated by such superficial
appearances. But many phenomena which lie on the
surface of a thing are either occidental only and do
not belong to the true nature of such thing, or, be·
longing thereto, do not belong to that part of it
which is distinctive and characteristic ; and thus
things become associated which, superficially re-
sembling, are really profoundly distinct3 and things
are separated which, really and essentially, belong to
each other ; and so the resulting classification is
incoherent and confused, presenting incongruity and
contradiction, and discordant to the intellectual con-
templation.

As however our notions of things become more
complete, the profounder points of resemblance and
difference are perceived as well as the superficial, and
such things only are classed together as really belong
to each other. And thus the resulting classification
grows more coherent and harmonicus; the intellectual
eye passes from one part to another without break or
impediment, and the mind derives the pleasure which
the free discharge of function always produces.
