But to vitalise food, and out of it to maintain and
reproduce itself, is neither all, nor the chief part of,
the purpose for which the human body exists and
which its food enables it to fulfil. What the vege·
table does indirectly and by sacrifice, that the vege-
table-like organs in the human body-those which in
structure and function are analogous to the vegetable
-do direotly and in fulfilment of their normal pur·

anda higher organisation. Just 88 the kingdom of
life springs out of the inorganic kingdom, so does
the kingdom of mind spring out of that of life.
The one fundamental attribute of mind is, as has
been said, conseiousness. Now this consciousness,
811 experience tells us, always exists in connection
with a peculiar structure, neree-matter. There is no
evidence of consciousness existing apart from this
matter: alsa, with a few doubtful exceptione, where·
ever the neme-matter existo, consciousness exists
also. Moreover, these two things always co=exist, as
to development, in the same proportions. Even in the
lowest grades of the animal kingdom which exhibit
any sign of nerve-structure, there is reason to believe
that some feeble consciousness is present, and, as
the nervous system advances in development in the

higher grades of animale, consciousness and mental
