they vere to be realised not having been thoroughly

To the form of aelfdeception which ia pmduoed by the uudua
influence os feeling, the term patheticfntlacy has been applied by
Mr Ruskin It seems to conaist in a want oi balance between
the sensibilities and conceiving faculty on the one hand, and tha
controlling power on the other. 'I'he mind, suffering lrorn tha
tension caused by the exciting conception with which it is over·
charged, and secking avent, ia driven to any object which preaents
any features ol affinity, and, without waiting to see whether the
other features correspond, credita it with all the reat- or rather,
investa it with thern, and thus surrenders itaelf to an ideal οἱ lta
own, which hae no existence out of itself3 and it is not until those
other leatines—in a moment οἱ clear perception-are disclosed
and found to disag1ee‚ that it is undeceived Such a mind livea
in an unreal world ol its own, in which everything is transfigurati.
To it lise is one continuone succession ot' dreaming and awakening,
of illusion and disenchantrnent; until it learns the necessity oi
making a right use of its perceptive faculties and being no longer
the lool of circumstances.

Into these two kinds of naturas, the sterile and the fertile, human
beings generally may be practically divided3 the distinguiahing
mark being the relative excess or deficiency oi imagination and
its accompaniment‚ passion. Relative, we say, not absolute; for ·
perhaps in no one is the conceiving faculty altogether wanting.
Practically‚ however, the clasaification holda good; all below the
average in this respect ranking with the sterile, all above with tha
fertile And it ia to be remarked that the difference between the
two is one of quantity rather than quality ; this latter depending
more on culture and training than on nature. Whatever the
culture, the product ol the sterile nature will be seeble and scanty,
that of the fertile nature vigoroua and abundant; and if, lor want
of proper training or culture, this one engendera more evil than
the other, yet on the other hand, it holds forth more promise.
Luxuriousness may be restrained, misdirection corrected, by art :
but bamenness is a curse.
