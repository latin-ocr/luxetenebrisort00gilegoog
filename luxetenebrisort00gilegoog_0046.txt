being possessing consciousness‚ connected with a
physical body, and the subject of various forms of
sensation and feeling3 or indirectly‚ through his ,
outward senses, which, revealing to him other bodies
more or less similar to his own, thereby furnish to
his reason grounds for inserting the existence of
other beings also possessing consciousness and con-
nected with such physical bodies. Such beings, not
being directly perceived by him, necessarily only
exist in his miudes notions or conceptions'. To
this class oi things the word psyctiool (from psyche,
soul), may perhaps without impropriety be applied3
and it will be so used iu this treatise. Of the beings
which composa it, all that we know is, that each oi
them manifeste in a greater or less degree the
phenomena of consciousness.

The last division of consciousness—the spiritual-
consists of things which are perceived neither through
the internal organis sense, nor through any of the
outward senses, but are presented to the mind only
through the medium of notions and conceptious
deduced by the reason from facts furnished by the

two other forms of consciousness. Such things,
presenting themselves (usually, at any rate) in no ,
physical bodily form cognisable by the sauses, may
be rightly called spiritual.

To each of the above three forms of revelation, the statements
and criteria of truth contained in §5 V, VL, VII, equally apply.
The soundness of this proposition will not probably be at once
admitted by every one with respect to the third form-the
spiritual revelation; or at least only so far as that branchos it
extends which is called natural theology,-a branch of theology
