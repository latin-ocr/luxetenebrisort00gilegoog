PSYCHICAL. 125

mingle with it, then the action does not proceed
entirely from the psyche, but, so far as such admix-
ture of feeling extends, from causes outside it.

This power of actiug lreely- of controlling thoughts and actions
by his own froewill-is one that every man possessos to some
extent by nature, but it can only be exercised in minds which
have been preserved from all vicious habits and tendencies-from
all tyrannies caused by the undue influence of things which act
on the different parts of the psychical nature—the sensual and
sensorious‚ the aesthetic, emotional, and theoretic-or in whom
such have been corrected; and it can only be maintained by the
habitual exercise of sels-respect. When the conscience has been
awalreued aud the discovery made that aelf-abasement is the
greatest of all, or rather, the only real humiliation ; and that sels-
reproach 11 the greatest of all miseries, 10 that no enjoyment is
possible while its sting is felt ; and that, on the other hand, sell-
approval based on the eonsciousness of acting right is the greatest
of all happiness, so that every miseryis beamble if such a con·
dition exist3 and that it isin the power ol every man to secure
this greatest good and to escape this worst misery, simply by
habitually keeping his inclinatione in check and consulting his
circumstances; not allowing himself to be committed to the
inlluence ol any until the impert of all has been weighed‚ and
never abandoning himself to any 10 far aa to lose the mental
equilibrium, but always keeping the circumstances in view and
preserving the power of withdrawal, should sufficient reason
appear ;-when such discovery has been made and the habit of
thus regarding the circumstances acquired, then freedom of will
' isestablished But until this lesson has been learnt, lreedom is
but an empty word. The only intelligible sense which this word
“free-will'' possessas is, freedom from the infiuence of feeling.
And the only condition consistent with the maintenance of such
freedom is obedience to the law of duty-to the word contained
in the circmustance Mera absence of restraint isnot freedom
but only a loose lawlessness. Until the sovereignty of reason is
recognised, licence is permitted to every feeling, and the psyche,
passive and inert, drilts before every passing induence. Licen-
tiousness, ifindulged in, 11 the certain fore-runner of some form

ol tyranny. ‘⁸ Only ia 1011000 tlte coutfvadsrcedom!
