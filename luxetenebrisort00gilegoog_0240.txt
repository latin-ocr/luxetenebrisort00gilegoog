220 LUX E TENBBRIS.

Teutons free thought is not wanting, and elevating
and liberating conceptione are in formation which in
time will break the chains of eustom and prejudice3
on the other hand, there are Oelts who have learnt
from experience the necessity of applying the
analytic intellect to the facts of reality. Such
influences will increase and such minds multiply‚
,and by·and-by they will rule. Both satiety and
privation help progress.

, “ 111010ΰο ccld blasts and icy winde serve good

As much as summer suns, Man yet shall reap
The harvest of his deeris and sufferings.
Then Liberty shall birthright be of all,
Epaulity mean equal right to claim

A share of God's best gifts, a share 011110,

And scope to use it for all wisest ends ;
Fretcrm'ty shall then be mighty hond,
Binding all men in glorious brotherhood.''

And so the time will come at last when all men will
march and progress under the banner of a common
Humanit. And when that time has arrived, per-
haps on that banner will be found inscribed the words
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,-w0rds which, how-
ever desecrated by contaminating associatione, yet
contain within them the only true principles by
which men can be rightly held together3 their
meaning in fact being precisely the same as the
hallowed and time-honoured Anglo-Saxon ones,
associated with the noblest chapters of our English
History-
rnuuuou, reru-amr, Bsomunoou.
