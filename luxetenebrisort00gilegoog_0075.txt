cause may be either an intense sensation or avivid object of sense,
or an emotion produced by a virid ides3 and the motiva forceis

The perceptione which the mind receives from outward things
at any time, depend as much on its own condition at the time at
which they are received as on the outward things which are their
source. They vary with the powers and capacities of the organs
of sense in different minds, and perhaps still morc with those of

the hrain is fatigued and feeble, or fresh and energetic; stupefied
with narcotics, or excited by stimulants; and especially, according

situated more profoundly and more remote frons the surfaoe, and
underlying as it were the more superficial parts, would bc capable
of awakening in the mind, by suggestion, the largest amount of
ideas ; and, perhaps, of adding to them, modifying them, and

everything proceeds from some other thing or conr-
hination of things to which it seems to owe its
existence ; and thus we form a notion of cause and
