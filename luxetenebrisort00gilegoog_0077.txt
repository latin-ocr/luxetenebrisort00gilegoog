the term intellectuat (intus, within, and lopo, read)
should, in strict propriety be limited. The ideas
and notions collected by the process of external
perception, and conserved in the memory, are recol-

within process—that of internal perception. Vicwcd
by the intellectual light which, reflected by the
objects of thought, reveals them to the mental eye
by a precisely similar process to that by which the
sensible light reveals in the mind the objects
of sense, these re-collected notions are compared
with each other: certain features are perceived
in everything to be peculiar to such thing, and cer-
tain other features that it possesses are perceived to
exist in other things as well: and they are thus
arranged in groups according to their likenesses. And
in the same way, in each'group certain phenomenaare
observedtobefpeculiar to the gronp, and certain other
phenomena tc belong to other groups also 3 and these
groups are then in the same manner combined also
into larger groups, according to their points of re-
semblance: and thus, hy this methodos closspication,

presents and the relations of resemblance and dif-
ference which these bear to the phenomena presented
by other things-the points of resemblance con-

And as this classification becomes more and more
perfect, and our notions cf the things which composa
