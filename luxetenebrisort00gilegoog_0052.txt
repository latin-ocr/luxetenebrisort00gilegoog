principle which it has always been attempted to substitute for it
isaccthority; not the authority which submits its credentials to
examinatior, and rests its claims for trust on reasonable grounds,
but that which refuses altogether to be questioned. Eveu in
physical researches, the free use of the reason is interfered with
whenever its conclusione come into collisiou with established viewa
Thus Galileo’s demonstration of the movement of the earth was, for
a time, suppressed by authority; aud thus, even in our own day,
it is abundantly evident that much, at any rate, of the opposition
which Mr Darwin's theory of the Origin of Species enconnters,
springs from the fact that it interferes with notions propounded by
authority. Still more evident and effective is the opposition of
authority to reason when we come to questions involving moral or
theological views-the subjectmatter of the last two of the three
divisions of consciousness spoken of above. It would be easy to
show that, with regard to the first of these two, there are moral and
social questions of vital importauce, couceming which our ideas aud
opinions are utterly confused and contradictory, yet into which
any attempt to intrude the reason would, by many persons,
be resented as if an attach on humanity itself were intended ;
while the spiritual revelation is openly asserted and main·
tained to be one made through no natural faculty whatever,
and to rest ou grounds with which the reason has nothing to do.
Authority is a principle rightly resorted to with those who either
have no reasoning faculty or will make no use of it-with the
immature, the insane, or the vicious3 but to apply it to those
who are tryiug to use their reason, is as if those who had eyes
were told to shut thern and follow the first voice they heard. To
follow leaders is right, aud to put trust in them is right also;
but those only are to be trusted who prove, by facts visible to
the eye, their claim to the title. Doubtless those who teach
that reason should be subordinate to authority, and not author-
ity to reason, are actuated by an honest fear lest reliance on a
human faculty should lead to error; but ‚this arises from an im-
perfect conception of the nature and true function of the reason
They, in fact, tellus to avoid fallacias by getting rid of the faculty
which is expressly given us to preserve us from fallacy.

It will be one of the objects of the present work to show that
all the revelations of consciousucss are revelations made through
