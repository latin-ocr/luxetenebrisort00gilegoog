¹forces obey such laws, and are obliged to content
ourselves with the fact without inquiring the reason,
this arises from the limitation ο1 our perceptive
faculties, which are unable to convey to us complete
notions of matter and force which form the elemen-
tary subject-matter of physical sciense3 for in the
ease of the pure mathematice, the elements-the
unit, the point, and the line—being perfectly com·
prehensible by the mind, so that complete notions of
such elements may be contained therein, ull the
possible combinations of such elements may also be
perfectly comprehended and conceived, and seen
necessarily to flow from their premises 3 so that the
mind being in possession of the whole of the
premises, th'e whole of the conclusione—every pos-
sible conclusion-can be deduoed therefrom by the
logical or reasoning process-hy that process by
which the intellectual eye is able to travel, without
break of continuity in the lines of vision, from one
notion or conception to another3 from a whole to
its parts3 from the parts to the whole ; from
premises to concludens, from principles to conse-
quenoes, and eice verset· and from two conceptione
to elaborate a third 3-without any reference to, or
uid from, without: and thus the mind, being in
possession of the whole truth, feels that at every
step it is on firm ground, and that all its concludens,
if rightly deduoed‚ are as certain as their premises ;
and the reason is perfectly satisfied. Doubtless, is
the physica] subject-matter-matter and force-
could be reduced to as perfect an analysis as the
mathematioal‚ so that equally complete and simple
