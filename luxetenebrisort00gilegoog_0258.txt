For the conception of the First cause, as a (iod of
loce, is manifestly inconsistent with that cf a Gnd of
ccnyecnce. He who taught men the duty cf doing
good, could He do evil? He who taught the duty cf
forgiveness, could He not forgive? By no logic are

Such a dilemma would in any other science than
theology cause no difficulty. It would constitute a
reductio cd absurdum, and would necessitate abandon-

conclusion-or, at least, reconsideration of the ’
grounds on which they rest. But this rectification
of error which in every other scienoe is the practice,
and which is the condition of all true progress‚ is in
theology not permissible. Free inquiry (and inquiry
is of little use if it be not free) into the grounds on
which any tradition or article of saith which has
received the sanction of authority rests, is not per-
mitted to the follower of a creed, and, lest notwith-
standing such inqniry should be instituted, and the
weakness of the grounds on which some dogma laid ,
down in less enlightened ages rests, should be per·
ceived, it has been the oustom with all theological
authorities to shroud such questionable dogmas with
a veil‚ and to inscribe thereon the word mystay.
And not content with this, reason itself-the one
