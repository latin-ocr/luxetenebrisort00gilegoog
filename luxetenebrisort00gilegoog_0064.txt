44 LUX E TENEBRIS.

The existence of matter is an inference of reason
from the facts of consciousness, and it therefore
belongs to the third class of knowledge spoken ofin
ξ V. It is a fect of consciousness, but a rational
one: adeduction, not an axiom of sense. But this
class of knowledgeis as certain as any other. The
existence of matter is as certain as that of mind,
but its nature is quite beyond our reacb.

§ XVIII. As the whole of the physical phenomena
of consciousness are mental, not material‚-phenc-
mena belonging to and developed within the mental
sphera, not obtrudcd into it from the material world,
-it follows that the physical facts which each
person's consciousness presents to him—bis physica]
consciousness—exist to such person in a form
peculiar to himself 3 that his objective physical
perceptione are as much his individual property as

, his thoughts, ideas, dc. are; and that such physion]

perceptione only resemble those of another person

so far as the two occupy the same stand-point, and
possess braina and orgens of sense structurally and
functioually in the same condition.

ξ ΧΙΧ. Each man's consciousness, then, is a

distinct thing, separated from every other man's, cs
are the several flowers on a plant, the several fruits
on atreo: separate, but united through the common
medium, matter, which connects them with each
other and with the parent trunk. Matter and mind
are therefore inseparably connected. Mind and
matter are words used to convey ideas of two things
which consciousness presents as distinct, and which
must be considered as the fundamental elements of
