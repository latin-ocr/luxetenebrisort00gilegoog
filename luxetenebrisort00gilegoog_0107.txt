mind, and more exciting to the psyche. Thus are
formed within the mind new creatione—r'dools—the

the degree of perfectiori iri which the elementary
notioris which compose them, and which have been
derived from things which have entered from without,

perfectiori of the operations of the intelleot and
imagination combined, and thus, just as it is necessary
