that ofa void or hollow sphere‚ outside, and in
immediate contact with which, is the material brain,

and beyond this again the persons and things of the
material world, with which the hrain is connected by
nerves distributed throughout the body. of the
nature of this sphere we know nothing: all our
knowledge is confined to its contents3 aud these are
the conscious being itself—the psyche, and the
various phenomena of which it is conscious. Compre-
hending, so to speak, these phenomena, the mind
does not comprehend itsels: i exists outside the
sphere of consciousness, of which, in fact, it forms
the limitation. Just as our elementary idea of
physical organisation is the simple orgauic cell, with
its vivifying, animating nucleus3 so our simplest
notion of psychica] organisation is the mental cell, with
its censemus, active psyche. And this analogy
between the life-cell and the mind-cell holds good in
this respect also: just as the life-cell draws from
outside things material which it elaboratas within
itself into specific products, and, giving thern out
again, modifies its surroundings thereby ; so the
mind-cell is acted upon and re-acts on its surround-
ings iu like manner, giving back again in an altered
form what it has received, and modifying thereby the
outer world in which it exists.

Neither do we know anythiug, absolutely, of the
nature of matter-the substance of the brain and
outside material world3 for this also, not entering
into the mental sphere‚ is not comprehended by it.
All that is known about it is conjectural, theory based
on hypothesis suggested by the physical phenomena
