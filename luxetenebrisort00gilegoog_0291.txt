For a man then to support adversity, he must
himself be adequately supported by his creed; its
conceptions must correspond to the facts of life.
And it follows that the smallest and narrowest
minds are supported by the narrowest crecds. As
the mental sphere enlarges, and the psyche risos in
proportion to command the whole intellectual
horizon, the broader and more messivo the support
it requires. Adrancing minds are therefore ueces-
sorily dissatisfied with existing creeds. These pro· ’
positions are amply borne out by experience.
Every creed can produce its martyrs—the lowest
and most degraded the most numerous. The sanatio
is usually narrow-minded. On the other hand, the
despairing dry wrung forth by the death-agony on
Oalvary has been reiterated by many a soul pro-
strated by the break-down of its creed under the
pressure of calamity. '

In saying that a man’s creed to be adequate must
be true, what is meant is, that it must be truth to
lim. It must not be contradictory to his perceptions
of fact. The creed of the best informed man is
based in great measure on error-on false hypothesis
-and necessarily must be so, while knowledge is
incompleta. But as long as the falseness of the
hypothesis is not perceived, the creed stands firm.
As soon, however, as the true facts come into view—
the fallacy on which it rests is detected: it sup·
ports him no longer3 it is no longer a thing to be
trusted—a creed. Further, it must be added, a
creed in supporting a man under the blows of afflic-
tion does not operate by producing in him apathy.
