it grow more and more complete, certain rules and a
certain definite plan begin to be perceptible in its
several parts or groups 3 and at last one great system
or plan begins to dawn upon the mind, the parts of
which plan arc perceived to have certain relations of
proportion to each other, so that—as far as the plan
is understood-on a thing being presented to -our
· notice we are enabled from some of its parts to affirm
the rest, and to put it in its right place in such
plan. Now this system—so far as it is truly formed-
is not an arbitrary invention of the mind, amere
fiction of the hrain for the purpose of holding to-
gether the ideas3 it is a real objective thing—a
system of physical truth-the true plan on which
physica] things are formed—the truc relationship in
which they stand to each other. All things in this
system are connected with each other by links of
affinity or resemblance, so that between no two
things there would be, wc are led to believe, if the
whole were known, any gap3 but each would pass into
the other by a succession of minute differences3 and
things at the extreme end of the scale be connected by
insensible steps. This process of elassification seems
to take place at first unconsciously in the mind. By
some law of hrain-action, it would seem that the ideas
which enter first are attracted to each other by their
points of resemblance without any effort of the mind
taking place3 and the total amount Ἴ of ideas not

being great, there is abundant capacity for the whole.
But as ideas multiply, the mind becomes burdened,
and a conscious effort is made to find points of
resemblance, and systema ofclassification are invented
