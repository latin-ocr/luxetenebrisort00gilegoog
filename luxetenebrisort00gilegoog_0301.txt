For the law 01 life being, as it nnquestionably
is, that all must suffer, and the highest natures the
most3 and that such suffering is, in some inscrutable
manner, at once the means and the test 01 goodness3
what could more reconcile the heart to such law than
the doctrine that this suffering to which the human
nature is liable is shared also hythe divine nature?
With this doctrine 01 the incarnation, then, Phi-
losophy has no quarrel. It harmonicas with all its
facts3 it supplies all its requirements ; and, viewed
apart from historical consideratione, on which its
verification depends‚ and with which the writer at
present has nothing 10 do, it cannot on rational
grounds be rejected by the philosopher. Yet 1ο en-
tertain it adequately, no common elevation 01 the
vision is required; and, therefore, until hy happy
training and right discipline, such elevation has been
attained, Christianity‚ however numerous those may
be who rank themselves amongst its votaries, must
be the creed 01 the few. To those who have learnt
the hrave creed that “ to suffer and be strong '' is
a sublime thing, and that in this way, and in this
alone, we become partalrers 01 the divine nature, it
matters little by what road such eminence may have
been reached. But, until such lesson hasbeen learnt,
the history 01 Him who died on Calvary only deepens

still more the mystery of Suffering.

satisfy fully the heart. It presente goodness to the
eye of faith, and rests that saith on reason so securely
