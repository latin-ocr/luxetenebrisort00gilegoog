The heart of the thoroughly good man is therefore

According to the view, therefore, that the object of
life is the development and perfectiori of the soul,
worldly calamity, while a benefit to the wrongly-
inclined, is no injury to the rightly-disposed man,
and it may be to him also a good. There is apassive
virtue which endures that is even ofa higher quality
than the active one which achieves. Man is called
upon not only to act, but to suffer in the caure of
right-to endure the inevitable3 and to develop
the power of such endurance, suffering, eveu to the
rightly-disposed, may be requisita Such suffering
teste the inteyrity of the mind-the strength and sin-
cerity of its convictione, and, by calling forth its pas-
sive powers of endurance-by developing the great
virtue fortitude—may correct any lingering wealr-
ness, and further the development of the soul. Then,
and then only, when man has learnt to bear the
inevitable without repining and secusing fate, will
patience—suffering-“ have worked out her perfect
worlr.''
