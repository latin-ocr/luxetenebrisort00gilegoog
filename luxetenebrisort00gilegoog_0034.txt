first reached, and from these we ascend to the higher
and more complex—from the region of inanimate
matter to that of life, and from the region of life to
that of mind 3 each step enabling us to perceive the
truth lying immediately above. And knowledge

outcome, advances also, and improves in proportion:
the conception of the artist, with his increasing
knowledge, becoming more perfect, and his method
more correct. (See Note B, Appendix.)

6. Ther in the history of this development a critical
period has arrived, and that on our conduct with
regard to it our progress and future welfare depend.
A firm footing has been gained on the physical, and
already from its highest summit, where it touches the
region of mind, we are enabled to survey that region
into which the next step will take us. Are we
prepared to take that step, or are we to remain for
ever stationary in our present position, “ letting ‘I
