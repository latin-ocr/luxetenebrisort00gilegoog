Art is the result of the efforts of mun to reelise his

the efforts of the artisan to realise physioal good,
result the useful arts3 from the efforts of the
educator and the statesmcu to realise moral and

of the thinker and the artist to express and seed the
mind with the views of truth and noble sentiment
which they have conceived, or to present to the
imagination pictures more interesting thau those
existing iu reality, result philosophy, literature, and
the fine arta.

And every art in its early stage is necessarily imper-
fect. Thrcugh defective knowledge, the ideal is either
imperfectly conceived or inadequately represented.
The artisan fails to satisfy the requiremeuts of the
body, the educator aud statesmau to produce private
and public virtue, the artist's creations exhibit false
fact aud false sentiment, and the theories of the
philosopher untruth. But as facts come iu, the
truths inscribed upon them are read, aud soience
begins. Science is perceived truth: the various
sciences form one organised whole, truth-an orgauio
growth, the parts of which are put forth iu a regular
order, not dependent on the human will, but deter-
mined by the Oosmos of which it is the expression,
and to the parts of which the several sciences
correspond.
