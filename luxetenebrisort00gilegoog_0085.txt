§XXVIIL Iu the manner that hae been described
the physical Ocsmos is revealed‚—the first cf the
revelatione of consciousuess of which the truth which
lies in the phenomcna is dieclosed to the mind. And
simultaneouely therewith, and through its agency,
another and more important revelation is going on:
—the psychical. Our notione of physical things
are not formed within our minds ae dry cognitione
merely, but, as they form, through the stimulation
which the cerebral impressione that have produced
them exercise on the hrain and thence on the mental
nature, they act on that nature, awakening therein
various phenomena-sensations, amotione, and other
phasee cf feeling of which the conscioue being per-
ceives itsels to be the subject ; and thus the conscioue
being itself—thequ, or Psyche—is brought into the
ephere of consciousness as aeubject forcontemplatiom
and, while the physical world ie being revealed to
us, we are also being rovealed to ourselvea And of
thie psychical revelation, ae of the physical oue,
the etartiug-poiut is the human body. J ust as
it is one of the first and the most constant of the
objecte presented to our senece, so are subjective
phenomena associated with it the earliest and most

invariable of the occurrences of our psychical history.
