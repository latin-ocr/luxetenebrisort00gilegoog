minor or less general principles, and the branches the majoros
'more comprehensive principles By the inductive process the
eye travels from the leaves to the twigs, from those to the branches,
and thence to the stem : by the deductiva process, having arrived
at a branch, it travels along such, and deduces all the twigs and
leaves in successicn which hang from, or depend upon, that
braneh. Or it may be compared to a boch in au unknown
tongue which we are endeavouring to decipher; the letters and
words representing the facts elementary and compound, and the

s'entences and larger paragraphs‚ the propositions, simple οι· -

complex, which such letters and words contain. At first onlya
few of the words are made out, and we conjecture ; then enough
are made clear to suggest the meaning of the sentence ; and at last

from the several sentences combined the whole is interpreted. x

Or it is as if we were secking to put together the scattered

fragments of an architectural building and so to arrive at the plan
of the whole. Fragments harmonising together would suggest
first subordinate features, and, from these, larger features would
be arrived at. And often, in the course of the investigation, when
there is a breach of continuity in the facts—the meaning of
certain words in the sentence not being made out, or certain
fragments of the building being wanting—the gap has to be filled
up by a supposition or hypothesis, and if such hypothesis be well
conceived, then the view of the plan of the structure, or meaning
of the sentence-«its theom-tuma out to be correct—is found to
be in harmony with the other parts ; and the theory is substan·
tiated. If the hypothesis be incorrect, the theoryis false; and
the facts must be investigated again for grounds for a fresh view.

§ XXVII. The human brain, then, is the highest
productos the physieal world Το it the physical
forces converge as to a focus, and in its structure
material organisation reaches its culminating point.
Of this structure the intellectual ganglia constitute
the main portion, the sensory ganglia are the portals,
and the nerves of the senses the avenues. For each
one of the five forms in which the matter whichis

the basis of the physical world exists--the solid, the
