lew may be gained, just as has been the case with the laws
regulating other departments of nature3 and so, lmowing the
conditione, we may be able to direct and control the results
and mculd them at will

If human conduct were absolutely unconditioned and
governed by no lsws, then it must be to an observer es if it
were the result of chance, and human nature would be
absolutely unintelligible, unknowable-even to infinite
intelligence. 'lhat is the alternative of not accepting the
doctrine laid down in the text. If, on the other hand, it be
governed by laws, it is intelligible-is able to be understood
by a sufficient intelligence Whether it will ever be reduced
to an exact science, so that one man could thoroughly under·
stand another man, is a question unnecessary to discuss It
, is idle to inquire into the limite of possibility. As a fact, we
know that men do to some extent understand each other3 that
some men possess this faculty in a greater degree-have more
penetration-than others3 also, that some men are more easy
to be understood-more candid and transparent—than others3
but that which is understood already partially, will, itis
reasonable to believe, be understood better, if more pains
and attention are bestowed on it On the doctrine oi the
text, therefore, there is hope oi human progress. On the
doctrine ol unconditioned freedom, there is none.

3. The doctrine of necessity favours the development in
the heart oi the sentiment of charity3 while the opposite ,
doctrine has the contrary tendency. For, whereas on the one
doctrine it is irrational to hate any one -however hateful his
· conduct may be-when we perceive that the difference
between him and us is only relative 3 that we ourselves
should act like him if placed in his mental circumstances,—
if in fact our respective selves were interchanged, and we saw
with his eyes, heard with his ears, felc with his feelings, and
were moved by his sentiments ; and that, as neither of us
have made ourselves, we have no more right to hold him
