understood, then, by subtracting mentally this, the
special can be etudied. But until things have been
obtained and learnt in their simple forms, they can-
not be comprehended in their combinatione, as thie
mental, abstracting, isolating process cannot be per-
formed. Thus in the mineral, matter ie presented to
ue in the inorganic form, and ite propertiee can be
studied undieturbed by the organic or vital foroee;
and, thie knowledge having been gained, we are
enabied, by abstracting from the phenomena which
the vegetable presente the propertiee which ithae in
common with the mineral, to obtain in the residue
those peculiar to vegetable life. And in the same

· way with the animal, which, besides presenting

phenomena which it has iu common with the mineral
and the vegetable, hae propertiee peculiar to itself-
the phenomena of consciousness 3—we are enabied, by
a previous acquaintance with the phenomena of mine-
roland vegetable existence, to abstract these mentally,
and ieolate and etudy separately, its phenomena.

The light of science, therefore, necessarily advancee
from the superficial to the deep 3 from the simple and
general to the complex and special. Of necessity
the more simple mineral or inorganic kingdom, the
basis of all, must be known before the organic and
more complex kingdom of life can be learnt3 and
thie latter again, before the yet more special and
complex kingdom of mind. of necessity, therefore,
the march of science ie slow, and the rectification of
erroneoue conceptione based on superficiei impressione
must be slow in proportion. But, ae it advancee,

this rectification surely, although elowly, takes plaoe;
