-he possesses much knowledge, but of its highest
branch-—ccrebral physiolopy—he knows nothing3 for
the function of the organ of which it treats is the
exciting the phenomena of consciousness in the mind,
and, until such phenomena have been adequately ·
investigated, such knowledge is impossible. Phy-
siology‚ therefore, stagnatesas ascience in all its
branohes in consequence of this defective knowledge
respecting its highest one; for the brain is through
the nerves connected inseperably with 811 the other
bodily organs‚ and none 01 these can be thoroughly
known in the absence of accurate knowledge respecting
it. And, in consequence of this defective physiology‚
the art, Hygiam, which is based on it, is also defec-
tive ; for, not knowing thoroughly the physiological Ι
law, we are unable to supply 811 the conditions which
secure that perfect performance 01 811 the physical
functions which constitutes bodily health. And what
is true 01 physiologyand its out-come, hygiene, or the
art of preserving health‚ 18 for the same cause true
of Pathology and its art, Theraponticc. For healthy
structure must be understood before diseased structure
can be made out; and, until diseased structure is
made out, diseased action cannot with any certainty ’

be rectified. The arts of Hyyicae and Therapontics .

are therefore necessarily in the empirical and con-
jectural stage of development. And yet more de·
fective are our Mental quiene and 1111000008ῑὶ08,-
for owing to our defective Cerebral Physiology, that
scienoe of which it holds the key,Pcyclroloyy, isin
so chaotic a condition that of its subject-matter,
mind and soul, we possess no distinct notions of any
