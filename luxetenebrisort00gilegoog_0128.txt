have learnt 10 perceive and correct the bad habit
which is the cause 01 their misfortunes.

Itis necessary 11111 11 should he clearly understood that when
it is said that every 111111 has it in his power, by obeying the laws
01 reason always to extract 1101111111 circumstances the utmost
good possible, the words “ circumstances '' and “ best '² are used ¹
in a relative, not in an absolute, sense. By “ circumstances '' is ἱ
meant, not the total amount 01 actual realities which are outside
and surround 1 man and effect his wallare, but only the total
amount 01 things, whether objecta 01 sense 01 objects 01 thought,
that lie, connected by the laws 01 perception, external and internal,
within the range 01 his faculties ; and by “ best‚” the best possible
to the individual perceiver. Outside truths do not enter an indi·
vidual mind so asto bc presentablc 10 consciousness, either
because such mind 11 not capacious enough to comprehend them,
01 has not had opportunity to collect them. Thus many truths
comprehensible recdily by the mind 01 a Goethe or a Newton
would be too lofty 01 100 extensive 10 be contained by many,
perhaps the majority, 01 other minds. Also the simplest truths
indicated by objecta present to the sensas would be as obscure
and as much hidden from minds 01 the greatest capacity, if there
had been no opportunity previously 01 forming the noticns
necessary for the comprehension of such, as the meaning 01 1
Greek book would be to the mind of 1 person unacquainted with
the language: for‚il no notions respecting a thing exist in the
mind, no notione can be excited by the presence 01 such thing.
The circumstances then of a man, in the sense in which the word

is here used-the amount 01 things presentable to his mind at
any time-are determined by such man’s mental capacity, by the
opportunities he has had 01 furnishing his mind with ideas, and
by the manner in which he has availed himself 01 such oppor-
tunities'. To such things, and to such alone, does the proposition
above stated respecting the laws 01 reason apply. A man is only

able to apply these laws to what lies within the range of his
vision. 01 things outside his mental horizon he is necessarily
ignorant. If he has made the most of his opportunities, he will
be right to the extent of 1111 capacity: 1111 notions will be scund,
