The common eye sees in tha whale a fish: the scientific one
discovers tho characteristic marks of amammal. Scin this
psychological question :—the common mind perceives thata
man’s conductis the result of his will, and that he has the
power (Note L) of putting this will-force in action or not, but
it does not look further aud see what the motives are, aud
whence derived, which have induced him so to exert himself.
Unless a man choose to investigate the subject, freely analysing
the mental phenomena—just as he would, in thc cases meu·
tioned above, the astronomical aud physiological-and diveat
himself oi all preconceived ideas and prejudices, ha clearly is
no more entitled to pronounce an opinion on this question oi

sions on any oi the problems oi astronomy or physiology.
But the chiei obstacle to the acceptance oi this doctrine of

absence oi freedom3 or they cannot, from want of training-
the absence oi wisdom3 or they dare not, from sear—the
absence oi saith: and this last is thc one that operates most
strongly in the case we are considering. They shrink form
the subject, for fear of fancied consequences that might spring
from it. Conscious that reason isjagainst them in this matter,
they endeavour to remove the whole subjectos the nature of
the will from its sphere 3 shrouding it in ambiguous words aud
calling it a mysteryt-Mystery-convenient word! whether
to excuse indolence, stills inquiry, or stop progress. Now,
although facts, once ascertained, must ba accepted with all
their consequences, yet it must be conceded that conclusione,
which seem to involve evil consequences, justify suspicion
and reconsideration of the road which led to them. J udged,
however, by this test oi consequences, the doctrine that the
action oi the willia conditional aud determined by causes that
it does not create ior itself, will contrast most favourably in
every respect with the creed thatis its alternative. Some of
