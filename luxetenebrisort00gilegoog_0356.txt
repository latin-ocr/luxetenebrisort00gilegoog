practice iu consequence of the conspicuous failure of
such mental cramming-in the mere exercise and
drilling of the bodily muscles and nerves, but in

the training of the intelleet and heart3 then such
method will be resorted to generally, aud education
will come to be in reality what it is in name-the educ-

In crimiaoljurisprudecce, too, the distinction which
hasbeen drawn between the soul and the mind, as
illustrated by the psyche and the mind-cell which it
inhabits, would be practically available. When it is
clearly seen that of the wrong conduct which the
criminal exhibito not all iscaused by wilfulstubborn·
ness and depravity, but some part is to be traced to
defective mental capacity and to want of instruction3
and that even for his sius of wilfulness the criminal
himself is not primorily responsible, since such
depravity of will arises from the want of that right
psychiual training which has just been spoken of ; ,
and that therefore, for the conduct of the criminal,
society is as responsible as himself—the cause in
both being the absence of the right mental concep-
tion-in the case of the criminal, of duty3 in the case
of society, of the training which would have developed
in him the habit of rectitude 3—wheu, we say, these
things are clearly seen, then an important advance
will have been made in solving the intricate problem
howthe criminal is to be dealt with3 andan additional ·
