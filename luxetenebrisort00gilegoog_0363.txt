the theologica resort for truth direct to the same
sources which inspired of old the great masters in his
science--to nature and the human heart3 and in
lieu of the worthless refusa which now goes
under the name of theology-the metaphysical moon-
shine which has been transmitted from the past
through intellectuel channels of constantly diminish-
ing calibre until all the goodness once in ithus been
removed—he will be able to offer to us a nutritious,
invigor'ating reality; a thing that will stand inspec-
tion3 the life and support of all things. Then will
ralipioa be again in fact what it has been in times past
, · -that which teaches us how to live and how to die ;
an art which men may profess without a blush‚ and
practice without degradation.

The practical benefits, then‚that the doctrines which
· have been put forth would, if verified, produce in the
world of fact and reality, cannot he denied: they
would let light into the regions of the psychical and
the spiritual, and so stimulate every branch of
social art.

But their effects would be equally great and bene· .

ficial in that department of mental activity to which
the term art is par excellence applied. Our life is
two-told. By the mysterious power of the imagina-
ti0n‚ which has been already discussed‚ the psyche
is able out of the materials which have entered tha
mind-cell from without, to create for itself another
world-the ideal—and so multiply and intensify ·
existence by surrounding itself with things more
stimulating than-and to iteelf as real as-the
actual one.
