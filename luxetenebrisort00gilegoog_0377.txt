NOTE G, page 86.

In physical things, as in psychical, the preservation of
composure or composition seems to be necessary for the
evolution of light. This may be illustrated by the hamc oi a
candle or lamp. There are in this three cones :-l. An inner-
1 most one, consisting of oil or iat which, liquidated by the hest,

and drawn up in the wiok by capillary attraction‚ has been
thence vaporised and forms the non-luminous dark cone which
immediately surrounds the wick. 2. A middle one, the seat of
light, composed of the same vapour, but more highly charged
with caloric in consequence ol its greater proximity to the outer
cone in which such caloric is generated3 but still retaining its

composition, and only manifesting the extra caloric with which .

it is charged by the light which it emits. 3. An enter, heat-
generating one, blnish and scarcely visible, in which the
combustible vaponr coming into contact with the oxygen of
the air undergoes decomposition-los'es its composure. rl'his
onter cone is the source of all the heat, but, with the loss of
its composure, it loses also its power of giving light. So in
. the hrain, when, either from morbid irritability of the organ
or from ideas too exciting loss of composure takes place—
·manifested physically by increase of waste of the organic
material, and psychically by emotion-there is proportional
