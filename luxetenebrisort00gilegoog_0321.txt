Above these are the ganglia concerned in producing
sensucus feelings in the mind—the concauus yon-
yliom'c system, and yet again above them the emotional
yanylionic system. In the former of these an object of
sense, in the latter an idea, is the immediate exciting
cause, and currents of sensuous and emotional feel-
ing so generated pass through one or more, perhaps
a whole chain of ganglia, until they are expended
either on the instruments which shape our thoughts,

actions of these ganglionic circles that all the
feelings, affections‚ and sentimenta of the soul are
produced, and it is from them that its desircs and

consciousness, but they may be usually controlled,
and within certain limita restrained‚ by the will;
and it should be the objectos moral training to keep
them in habitual subjection thereto. And the highest
of all these circles of nerva-force is the intellectuat
yaaylionic system: that circle which is illumined by
the pure intellectual light, nncoloured by any
admixture of feeling. By its agency the psycheia
