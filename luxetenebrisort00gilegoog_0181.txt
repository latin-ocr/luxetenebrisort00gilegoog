human vill is conditioned, like every other thing
in nature ; that it is dependent on the intellectual
and moral conditions of the mind: and 2. That
these intellectual and moral conditione constitute
the mental circumstances of a man, and that these
mental circumstances and his actual surroundings
are two distinct things3 the former varying in differ-
ent men even when the latter are the same :—until
these truths are recognised and acted upon, it will be
impossible that we can make any important advance
in either psychology or sociology. Suppose that we
had made similar errors in our observatione and rea·
sonings on the facts of the physical world—that we
had held the inorganic atoma of the mineral to be
responsible for the flaws and blemishes in the crystal;
the organic material elements cf the vegetable and
animal for their blight and disease3 instead of the
surrounding conditione - defective culture and
absence of chastening and refining processes3 un-
suitable food‚ soil or climate 3—where would have
been the arts of the horticulturist, the metallurgist,
’ the physician? and where the soiences of chemistry‚

⁸ physiology and pathology? Doubtless the time will
come—or, rather we may say, is coming—when it
will be universnlly admitted that moral and social
disorder depend on causes and are conditioned
by circumstances as much as physical disorder is,
· and that the social organismis as amenable to re·
fining and re-forming processes, based on scientific
principles, as the aggregation of atoma that com-
pose the physical cosmos. For the analogy is very

close. The physical atom's behaviour is deter-
