vidual are limited to himself, selfish consideratione
exclusively rule in his mind: his own interests,
opinions, and sentimenta occupy him; he feels only
for himself ; and to self the rights of all other per·
sons are sacrificed. But if his mind be free to

expand, by-and-by his view enlarges, and more ’

liberal conceptions are formed3 the space in his mind
which was occupied by himself is shared by othere,
aud they and their belongings exercise their due in-
fluence on his conduct. It is the same with a state.
In 'a state, as longas the tyranny of a class existe,
an undue share of every good in the power of a govern-
ment to obtain is appropriated by such class; laws
are passed and monopolies formed sor the purpose of
securing to its members wealth and influence‚ honour
⁴ and dignity3 and institutione are created for the
purpose of establishing and imposing on others views
and opinions in conformity with those entertained by
them. But if the nation be permitted to develop,
other classes spring up, and liberating intluences
begin to act The new classes thrust themselves into
notice, and obtain a share of the attention and con-
sideration of the state-freedom of thought and of
action, and participation in the government, and in
the honours, dignities, and profit accruing thence 3
and thus, one by one, monopolies are abolished-
trade is made free 3 liberty of thought and of speech
is permitted, and institutione favouring any par-
tioular class of opinions at the expense of the rest
are got rid of3 power and influence are opened to all;
honour is paid to personal merit alone, and patente
of nobility fail to secure respect where real worth is
