every side ireely and iu full measure, been raised to his full
mental stature and proportione, has no more reason to boast
over his more lowly and less symmetrioal follow-mnu than a
tree that, placed in a rich soil, has been raised by the free ο
influx oi the physical light to its lull development, has to
glory over the stunted and croolred growth oi other vegeta-
tions placed in situations where the access of light has been
difficult and partial only.

The analogy is great, The physical conceptione oi the trec
—its leaves aud buds-ara formed hythe light out ol matter
derived from without, and by their influeuce the trunk oi the
tres is raised and its direction determined But, however rich
the soil, the leafconceptions will not be formed unless the
light have access; and in whatever directions the light ap
proaches it, in those directions it will grow. Il the light
descend from above, the tree is drawn upwards and becomes
straight, erect, lofty. If the light only resch it from below,

it spreads itself out on the ground. If· the light be not full
and free on all sides, but approach it from one side only,
then the leaf-conceptions that it forms ars onesided and

partial accordingly. Ι1 is the same with the mind and its
conceptione These latter determine its growth and attitude,
but they will not be evolved unless the light be admitted to
them Every mind, like every tree, has its typical form, but
’ 10 develop such perfectly there must be right culture as well
as nourishment-—education or evolution by the light of reason
as well as intellectnal food. “As the twig is bent, the tree
is inclined ” is a rule that holds good in both cases.

And it is worth remarking that of these three conditiona—
the nature, the food or soil, and the light—which determine the
development of both the physical and the psychical thing, the
first and last seem to be sufficient for their purpose, even when
the supply of food, whether physical or mental, fumished by
the circumstances, is reduced to the most scanty measure.

A noble nature, whether man or trec, freely exposed to the
