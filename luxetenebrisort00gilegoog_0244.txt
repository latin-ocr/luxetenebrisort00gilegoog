·samc proportion of uncertainty that exists with
regard to these three classes of facts exists with
regard to reasoning based cn them-conceptions of
the mind based on the facts distinctly seen are
tolerably correct; those based on the dimly seen arc
liable to error3 while those which have no support

portion with every change. And it is the same
thing with our conceptions of spiritual goodness and
beauty. As we are driven by the exigencies of onr
theoretic faculty to seek in the spiritual region the
