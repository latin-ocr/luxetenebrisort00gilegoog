effect. And with this notion of cause we are led to
associate the further notion of force, by the per-
ception of force or power of which we are conscious,
either when we act through our bodies on the material
things around us, and produce change in them, or
when material things act on us. Hence the notion
of cause invariably and necessarily suggests that of
force. And as a consequence of this habit of viewing
things in their relation to each other as cause and
effect, in forming a notion of a thing, we seelr to find,
in order to complete such notion, not only volat it is,
but whence it proceeds. Again: we also perceive that
everything is capable of acting in some way on other
things ; that it is not only itself a produced pheno-
menon, but that it is able in its turn to produce: and
hence we are led to inquire what its properties and
capabilities are3 what effectsi can produce on the
things around it ; what phenomena it will occasion 3
and to what results i is tending: and so we are not
satisfied with our notion of a thing until we have
also asked and received an answer to the question,
curcua. The What? the thnce? and the Whither?
are the three questions which we seek to obtain an
answer to through our perceptive faculties,respccting
every physical fact or phenomcnon which has been
presented to our notice, and of which we are endeav-
ouring to form a notion. When these questions have
been answered we have obtained all the knowledge

that our faculties permit us to receive respecting such
v fact. It is understood.
