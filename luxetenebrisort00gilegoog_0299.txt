that when that goal is reached, the solution of every
difficulty will be accomplished. Such a oreed may
satisfy the intelleot, but scarcely the heart3 for to
win this latter orgau the warm approbatiou of the
feelings is requisito, as well as the oold assent of the
understanding.

Reason, it is true, teaches us that towards a Being
who is all-good, and in whom we can trust with con-
fideuce, love should be felt3 audit is the custom of
oreeds based on the theory of spontaneous volition to
exact this sentiment from the heart as a duty. But
the beart, as has been already said, is an involuntary
orgari, and will not obey the will or surrender to
authority ou compulsion. Itis amenable only to laws
of its own, the leading one of which is that to win its
love there must be presented to it a lovahle object
It is true that there are some natures—women mostly,
or else feminine men—who seem to love for the sake
of leving. Weak in character, with dull perceptione
and feeble wills‚ they are unable to stand alone, and
throw themselves for support on any object that
offers. For them one creed will answer as well
. as another, for they never bring the understanding
to bear upon the subject, but submit to any autho-
rity that puts forth a'claim, and are plastic in any
hands that are firm enough to mould them. Such
persons are the ready material for the spiritual
charletan3 and it is on such he preys. But, more
masculine mindo decline to be blinded, and to take
on trust that which their own consciousness repudi-
ates3 and while they respond to goodness that is felt,
they resent unhindness.
