solicitous to preserve unbrolren the connection between the
past and the present, and to permit the destruction of nothing
in which any vitality can be discerned, is as much a promoter
of progress aethe Liberal who is bent on pruning and lopping
off every excrescente and dead part of the social organism, and
on opening and expanding every portion to its utmost limits .
and diffusing its benefits throughout the whole structure.

The Liberal, who ·in his hatred of wrong passionately and
fanatically cuts away all alike, living and dead, is as mucha
violator of the law of rectitudo as the conservative who, with .
equal fanaticism, worships dead similitudes, and in his
slavish idolatry for some cherished and timehonoured social
growth, is blind to all its imperfectione and loses sight of the
objects which it was intended to serve. Liberality is a term
which has reference properly to a man's mental attitude, not
to his opinions ; and the narrowest Conservative who has
freed his mind from the influence of feeling and prejudice, and
who is honestly striving to ascertain what is true in order to
do what is right, is a greater friend to progress, aud a better
citizen, than the most advanced Liberal wh0,',infatuated by
some ideal of social good which heis secking to realise, hes
forgotten his duty to the circumstances of the hour.
