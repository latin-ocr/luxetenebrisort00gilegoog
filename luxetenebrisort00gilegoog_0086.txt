informs each of us of his own existence as accnscious
being, bnt also of every change in or modification of
such existence-has been already stated. It has

like every other sense, on the action of a bodily organ 3

fications are produced by material change taking
place ontside that sphere. The two classes of pheno-
·mena, the physical and the psychical, agree in being
essentially mental phenomena, and in being depend-

material bodily organs3 such conditions being only
