and broken up into its organic elementa before these
can be assimilated and recombined into those higher
organisations which, formed by the vital processes
within us, composc our bodily structure and maintain
our physical life3 so is it necessary that our mental
food should also be digested‚ or separated and broken
up, before it can be built into the conceptione which
form our mental life. ·
In this manner each man’s consciousness is con-
stantly becoming furnished with new contenta,
varying with the powers of the conceiving faculty
which organises them, with the nature of the food‚
and with the digestive power. And the'se new con-
ceptions are more complete and satisfying-eaoh to
the sense to which it appeals—than the realities
which have entered direct from the world without3
and, although they have no actual existence apart
from the mind in which they are formed, yet they
have, so far as they are truly formed, a potential
existence3 their truth or falsehood and possibility of
realisation or the contrary being dependent on the
conformity or non-conformity of the intellectual
notions out of which they have been formed with the
existing realities of the outer world which those
notions are supposed to represent. The conceptione
of the imagination then depend for their accuracy
on the notions of the intelleot. If these latter are
correct, then the former, being based on right prin·
ciples‚ are sound and capable of realisation, oppor-
tunity offering. But if false elementa have entered
into them, they are unsound, and worthless in prac-
tice. '
