ξ Llw. Sterting, then, from its own perceptione
as promises, the mind can by a reasoning process

’ form notions thereof. And the accuraoy of such

notions can be tested by repeated observations and
by experiment, each observation correcting or oon-

facts perceived by ourselves and from the testimony

facts have been observed, the testimony werified, and
the inferences drawn. And, as with our notions of
physical things so with our psychical notions, when
facts are ·insufficient we supply their place with oon·
jecture3 and often allow such conjectural notions to
mislead our understanding and influence our conduct,
to the exclusion of more true and just views. And if,
in our psychioal inquiry‚ difficulties are often met
with through the illusory and evasive character of its
objecto, a parallel is presented in physical investiga-
tion, where similar difficulties are encountered: the
phenomena being often equally specions, evasive,
and hard to analyse. In both departments of know-
ledge, however, such difficulties are surmountable,
and progress is made in proportion to the care and
attention bestowed.

The proeesses by which we perceive and form

notions of things and people, if analysed, agree in
