that reason 101110 true light to light ns on our way3 that
rites and ceremonias, except so far as they are related to it,
010 useless and vain 5 that obedience to it is the only real
moral obligation-an obligation better than sacrifice or 1110
blood of> rama-it supplies at once a standard and a measure
of duty. While strengthening the obligation oi doing right
by referring it to its true principle, it at the same time
recognises the claim 01 every man to have 1110 conditione
requisito for the operation of this principle fnmished him ;
and thus by eularging men's ideas of justice, it multiplice the
bonds of sympathy which unite 1110111. 11 0100, while fully
recognising the imperfectiori of human nature, vindicates it
from the aspersions that have been so 110011 cast upon it
It offers the highest motivas to exertion. It tells ns that
man is 0 problem to be solved by the intellect, just as other
problema are: that on the solution 01 not of this problem
depends psychical happiness and misery—just 00 on the right
solution of physioal problems, physioal 'happiness depends:
that there is therefore a soience called psychology, and that by
the mastering and right applicetion of the laws of this 00101100
moral happiness can be ensured—just as, by the right under-
standing of the laws of physiology and the practicnl appli-
00110ηο01 the deductions therefrom, physioal well-being is to
be obtained: and that we have 110 111010 1000011 10 despair 01
success on account of 10111110 hitherto in the 0110 00101100 111011
111 the other. Old 00 the world is, physiology is but 0 00101100
01 yesterday: it is still imperfect, yet men 000 11011 that 0
knowledge of its laws lie within their 100011, and seeing this,
their intellects and energies are put forth in the right direction.
Lat them be once awahened universally to the fact that mind
as well as bodyis governed by laws comprehensible by the
understanding, they will advance in this highest department
01 knowledge 00 certainly as in the other; with practical

. results more important still.
