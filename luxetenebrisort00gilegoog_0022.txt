and soeial miseries result from our ignoranee of the
functions of the brein and of the mental laws which
are related to it l—of the scienee of psychology?
Pursuing this line of thought, the further reflection
occurred, that in the caseos the hrain, asin that of
the other organs of the body, knowledge of fonction
would never ¹be arrived at by the study of structure
alone. The structure of the lungo, even exhibited
by the most thorough dissection, would never have
revealed their fonction, ifthe air—both that which
