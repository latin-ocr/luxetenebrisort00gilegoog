gained towards a knowledge of the more complex
things into whose composition they enter. Thus the

inorgauio or mineral kingdom of nature is learnt first,
because it presente itself informs unmixed with the
others: when it has been comprehended, a step is
gained towards eomprehending the organio kingdom
of life into which its material enters. So also the
animal kingdom, or that of mind, cannot be eom-
prehended until that of life which is associated with
it-from which it springs and on which it is based—
hasbeen learnt. Of necessity, therefore, the science
of mind is the last of the natural sciences to pass from
the chaotic stage into that which—all the parts being
understood, and the ratio or relations which they
bear to each other perceiwed—may be properly called
rational.

1 But there is yet another reason for the law that
the simpler and more general phenomena must be
known before the more complex and special can be
understood. The unity oi nature and mutual depend-
euce of its parts is nowhere better shown thau in the
analogy which runs through the whole—the plan of
the more complex and later-developed structure being
sore-shadowed, as it were, in the lower and simpler
oue which preceded it, and out of which it sprung.
Thus each department of knowledge furnishes the
key which euables us to unlock the oue which lies
next to it in elevation and order of complexity. Pure

. Mathematica is the most simple aud general of the

whole, all the knowledge required to start with in it
being certain elementary ideas respecting number,
space, and quantity. Such elementa existinand belong
