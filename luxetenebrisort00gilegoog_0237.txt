standing inoreases will grounds for misunderstanding
diminish, and they will pereeive and fulfil their
duties to each other-each doing to every other all
the good it ean—and so forma real brotherhood of

that of a nation are therefore strictly analogous, and
are developed on the same principles.

Mr Herbert Spenoer has discovered a resemblance
between psychical organisation and physical, and
has traced the analogy to a surprising extent. Com-
paring the physical cell with the psychical individual,
he has shown that the principles on which these
cells are arranged in the various physica] organisms,
from the lowest to the highest, agree closely with
those on which human societies are constructed3 the
lower organisms corresponding to the more primitive
and barbarous communities, the higher to the more
civilised. Itis evident, from the facts he has pro·
duced, that the analogy is too close to be occidental
only, and the inference is that the laws of life
resemble those of mind—the psychioal forces acting
in the one department of nature in the same manner
that the physioal forces aot in the other—and that,
when the sciences of biology and psychology are
thoroughly known, common principles will be found
to pervade them. Such conclusione will not startle
those who refleot that not only does the kingdom of
mind spring out of that of life, but that every mental
change has its corresponding vital one3 that each is
to the other alternately 'as an effect and as a cause,
