to every department of knowledge, and there is good
ground for believing that all the processes of nature in
every department may be brought under laws capable of
beingexpressedbymatbematicalformulas. Suchabelief
seems to be a necessary consequence of the hypothesis
of the existence of a perfect and universally directing
spirit. Aperfect Intelligence must of necessity order
and regulata its work by perfect and undeviating
laws capable of being calculated and predicted by
intelligences of sufficient capacity3 and, as man has
been endowod with a mind capable of comprehending
the simplest of such laws, and of rising thence by pro-
cesses of reasoning to higber‚ there is reason to hope
that by means of this faculty, if used fearlessly and
with confidence or saith, he may rise ultimately to
the highest of all, invade and occupy every department
of nature, and wrest from ber her inmost secreto:
but the process is gradua13 and the lower steps must
be surmounted in succession before the higher can be
reached. By applyingour mathematical reasoning to
the physica] forces which are common to matter in
all its forms, whether ponderable or imponderable,
we step from the pure mathematica to Physica, and
reduce this department of science—the next to it in
order of simplicity and generality-to a rational
form. A knowledge of the physical forces common
to matter in all its forms supplies us with a clue to
the more subtle forces which give to each of 'these
forms its special peculiarity‚ and so from physics we
pass to chemistry—to Inoryonr'e Ctemiatry first, and
thence, applying the mathematica] formulae which
explain the more simple combinatione of matter
