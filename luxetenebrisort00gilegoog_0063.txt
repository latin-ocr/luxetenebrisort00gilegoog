reasoning that our sensations are mental phenomena
also. That such sensatione do not depend for their
existence on the material structure to which they are
referred has already been demonstrated; while that
they occupy the sphere of consciousness equally with
the physical phenomena must be admitted. If there·
fore that sphere be a mental one, they must be
mental phenomena

ξ XVII. The conclusion must therefore be ac-
cepted as based both on reason and on the direct
testimony of our perceptione, that both the physical
objecta which we perceive and our so-called “ hodily
sensations,'' are strictly mental phenomena; and,
this admitted, it will be unnecessary to add that
the other phenomena of consciousness—-objects of
thought as wellas objects of sense, emotions as well
as sensatione—are all mental phenomena als0. They
are all phenomena existing in the mind entirely,
although there is abundant physiologica] and patho-
logieal evidence to show that all of them always
require for their production the condition of material
change taking place within the brain. Until we
have reflected on the subject, we confound the per-
ceptione excited by material things with the things
themselves that excite such perceptione. When
seience has corrected this error and taught that
matter—the cause of physical consciousness—is a
thing nnattainable by direct perception, and that,
necessarily, all that we can ever know respecting it
must be derived from the physica] phenomena which
it occasions, then some men have run into the
opposite extreme, and denied its existence altogether.
