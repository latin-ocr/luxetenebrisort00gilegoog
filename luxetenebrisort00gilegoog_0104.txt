which it is incorporated, and as the sensory and
intellectual organs of the hrain which are concerned

in the higher psychioal manifestatione are as much
bodily organs as those which give rise to the lower, it

phases of feeling-whether high or low, must be pre·
sented in consciousness through the organic sense. It
must be distinctly understood that nothing positive is
affirmed here respecting this sense beyond the fact that

it existo, and that its fonctions are discharged like
those of the other senses through the instrumentality
of a special physical structure. That emotions
and sensatione exist3 that soch emotions and sensa-
tions are referred tc and represent the conscious
being, constituting what is called the epo, the soff,
the psyche· and that the conscious being-the eqo
—is distinct from the things of which it is conscious
ss-from the noo-epo-are facts of consciousness. It
is also a physiological fact that consciousness is the
fonction of the brein, and that the different pheno-
mena of consciousness are produced by distinct
cerebral structores. The fonction of presenting the
eqo being distinct from that of presenting thenon-eqo,
the structores which perform such fonction should
also be distinct. By what series of structores or
ganglia it is discharged, it is sor the anatomist and
physiologist to determine. As the sense ranges
through all the extent of our consciousness, including
all our affections and feelings, no doubt the range
of structore in the ,brein must be proportionably
wide. As emotion and sentiment have reference to .
ideas, and are manifested only by the higher animale,
