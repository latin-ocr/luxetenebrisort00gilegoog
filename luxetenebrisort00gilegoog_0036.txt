is moral agreement. While omoral chaos existe,

satisfied until the termination of that path has been
reached

That the presentis not an unfavourable time for
entering on psychical and moral investigation, many
consideratione concur in suggesting. Never was
inquiry on every subject more free than now 3 while,
on the other hand, sciense has both raised 101 us 0

we can survey the territory to be invaded, and has
forged 101 00 0 weapon-the method of inductiva

reasoning-by means of which we can take posses-
sion 01 the same. The conquest 10 within our reach,
if we will raise ourselves to 001 1011 height 3—we
have the power, if we have the will.

“lt is our will
Which now euthralls 00 10 permitted 1113
We might be otherwise ; we might be all

We dream ol, happy, high, mejesticul·’'
