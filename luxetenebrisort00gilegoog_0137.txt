together: the one is the cause os the other. A mind
with a feeble conceiving faculty is incapable of
strong passion. It may have sound intellect‚ clear
perception of the real with its good and evil, its
beauty and deformity: but its horizon is bounded by
tha actual, it has no cloud-land. Nor has it the
power of conceiving from what it sees that which it
does not see-from the near the distant, from the
apparent the hidden-of penetrating into the in·
visible. Nor of conceiving things visible in a
different combination or order from that in which
they appear—of perceiving in the real the goodness
and beauty which exist there potentially—of extract·
ing the ideal from the actual And this is equally
true of such minda, whether with reference to things
existing by the will of man, orto things which arise
from causes outside and independent of his will Το
them things established by authority -the enactments
of human lawa-are as ordinances of natare, and, in
each case, they consider the thing that is, that which
must be. And they are as incapable of entertaining
original conceptione offered by other persons as of
forming them themselves. They peroeive that the
. thing proposed isunlike anything that existe—that
. it is something that no one has ever seen or heard of
before—a new thing-an innovation 2-that is enough
Το realisc it, alteration must be made; something
must be ’ displaced3 trouble must be tahen3 diffi-

culties encountered3 risle—even danger-incurred;
suffering undergonez-all thia they sec very clearlyss .
But they are unable to aee, wanting imagination to
conceive, the greater good that will be substituted.
