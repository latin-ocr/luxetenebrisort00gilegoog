number of sets or series of ganglionio eireles differing
iu extent and function, along the nerve conductore of
which, currente of nerve force are transmitted, cells
varying in number and kind being interpused along
the line of transmission. Of the different sete, that
which ranks lowest in the scale as regards couscious-
ness, forming as it were the base of the pyramid, is
the one which may be appropriately called the oitcl or
cryanic yanylionic system. The numerous ganglionic
circles which compose it preside over the functione
which are concerned in building up and maintaining
in its integrity the structure of the body. Matter
introduced from without is the excitant, aud the
reflex force which is called forth is expended in
applying such matter to its proper purpose in the
organism, or in removing it when it has served this
purpose and hy use has become effete. These funo-
tions ure normally performed without exciting any
cousciousness in the mind, except perhaps a feeble
sense of corporeal existence, and over them the will
has no direct influence. When exceptioually exalted
or depressed, however, they produce corresponding
conditione in the psyche3 and if their function is
materially interfered with or impeded, they may
cause psychical agony so intense as to overcome it
altogether. Somewhut higher in the scale are the set
of ganglia which may be called the eeueuul yuayliouic
apoteca These ure in more immediate communication
with the outer world, and regulate the import and
export of material necessary for the purposes of the
body. They preside over the animal appetitos, and

of their action the mind is habitually couscious, and .
