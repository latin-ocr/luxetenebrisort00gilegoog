as one great plan, divided into three portions, the
past, the present, and the future. (Note N.) The ,

becoming a portion of the past3 the future is rolled

The present is the result of the past3 it proceeds ’
from it as a spring flows from its source, or a tree

andalao unalterable, it follows that the future'is
already ordained and unalterable ; and that if a mind
could comprehend thoroughly and contain all the past ¹
and present, it would also be· able to comprehend per-
fectly and predict the future: the forces in action being
known, with their laws and the existing conditione,
the future would be deducible. In the present, then,
are all the materials out of which the future is to be
formed ; and in it exist, either stored up potentially
or in actual operation, all the forces which constitute
the formative power. Pro-eminent among these con-

capabilities and forces—its perceiving and conceiving
powers, and its will-foree—its power of setting in
action its will, and of expressing and producing its
conceptione, and so giving birth to the future. This
will-force which, existing in every human being,
