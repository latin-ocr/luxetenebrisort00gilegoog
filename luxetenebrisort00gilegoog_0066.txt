comparative indifference all theorias dcduced either from physical
science or from metaphysical speculation. The metaphysician,
hedgcd in ¹on all sides by the dogmas of theology‚ which he was
not lree to transgress, has been engaged lor the most part in
pursuing phantoms, the productione of the fogs which his close
and darkened territory has so prolifically engendered 3 while the
cultivator of physical science hasbeen slowly and painfully
plodding on his way, collecting his facts and generalising tharson,
guided by the sure light ol inductiva reason. And the result is,
that opinion is gradually drifting into materialism In the
process of inquiry it has been ascertained that the two classes of
things into which all phenomena are divided, the physical and
the psychical, depend alike for their manifestation on a material
thing, the brain3 and, as it has been taken ior granted by the
physical inquiner, for want of sufficient metaphysical knowledge,
that the former-the physical phenomena—have a material basis,
logically‚ and as a natural consequence, the opinion is growing
in his mind that the psychical phenomena have a material basis
also. Both classes of phenomena are situated in the same sphere,
and hold towards the brain a similar relationship. If that sphere
· be a material one, then both of them are material phenomena.
Or put it in another way :-Ii the physical things which are
presented in consciousness as objects oi sense, and which impress
the mind as such, be in truth the very identical material things
which impress through the material organa of sense the brain-
substance, then the mind itself-thc thing impressed by such
objecta-must be, bya parity of reasoning, that substance3 and
materialism results. And the effectos such reasoning upon the
mind of the physical inquiner is much increased by the fact, that
the influence of consideratione which might be advanced against
such view from other sources is so weakened as to be virtually
of no avail. Metaphysics he has been accustomed to considera
mere mistland, in which fancies ere taken for realities, and into
which whoever ventures will be lost; while the same cause, the
advance oi physical sciencc, which is impelh'ng him in this
materialistic direction, is, gradually but infallibly, bringing about
another thing, viz, the downiall oi all dogmas, theological or
otherwise, which do not rest on a rational basis. This question
then of the materiality cr otherwise of the physical phenomena
cf consciousness becomes one of vast importance, involving among
