collection of individuale, and its will is the expression '
of the resultant of the wills 'of' its constituente. In
the savage or hunting state of society,-tlre: members
are actuated mainly by the desire of the immediate
gratification of the bodily appetites, like the animale,
from whom they have scarcely emerged: physical
strength therefore rules, and the opinions and senti·
ments of the strongest govern. In such a society,
sensual and sensuous things are the main objects of
pursuit,⁴and no sentiments or opinions are tolerated
but what flatter the feelings or stimulate the passions
of the rulers. As society advances and knowledge
of facts increases, pastoral, agricultural, commercial,

- and manufacturing communities gradually make their
appearance3 the conception of providing for the
future is formed 3 and property gives adventitious
power and displaces brute force. But property brings
leisure, and leisure gives opportunity for culture3
and so taste improves, and cultivated classes with
higher ideals and nobler desines are produced. And
these more enlightened and cultivated classes, in pro-

existing, in the same proportion perceive the obliga·
tion of attempting to remove such, and lend their
sympathies and aid to those who are weak and
oppressed. But this condition is necessary to pro-

. so greatly as to outbalance that of all the other classes
and members of the society combined. In suche
case, progr-ess would be impossible ; for it may be
taken as a law that no class in a society will ever
voluntarily open itself to motives‚ or permit principles
