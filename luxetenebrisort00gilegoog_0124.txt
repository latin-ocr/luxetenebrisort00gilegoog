motives which press on the psyche oroonscious being,
and cause it to act

And the psyche is impelled to act, not only by the
conception of some good, but also, and equally per-
haps, by the concurring conception of the correspond-
ing evil operating in the same direction. Thus vve seek
to satisfy an appetite, as much to relieve a pain as to
obtain a pleasure ; we provide for the future, as
much to escape a threatening danger as to secure an
agreeable prospeot; we cultivate taste and sentiment,
as much because we have an aversion for ngliness
and basenens as because we admire beauty and love
goodness 3 and we pursue truth, as much because
darkness is gloomy and dangerous as because light is
cheerful and pleasant. And thus,as these conceptione
of good and evil, awahened and suggested in accord-
ancewith the laws of thought, ariseinthe mind,aseries
of desires and aversions are constituted, attracting and
repelling the conscious being according to the degree
of distinctness in which they are presented in his
mind. The mind can be no more set in action with-
out a motive than :a physical thing can be with-
out a force being applied to it. And, like physical
things also, motives differing in force are required
to setin action different minds. Light and unstable
ones are moved hythe slightest things, while it
requires motives of weight to operate on, or alter,
more stable characters. Also,‘as with physioal things,
if several motives are acting in the same mind at the
sometime, it moves in the direction of the stronger,
or, rather, in the direction of the resultant of all such
forces—in the directiones the least resistance. Now
these various motives differ very much in the influence
