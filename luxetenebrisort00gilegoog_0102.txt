a satisfactory notion thereof, our perceptive faculty
is functionally impeded, and we suffer the intellectual
dissatisfaction which doubt or uncertainty respecting
a fact produces. Also, if, facts being clearly per·
ceived, we are unable, in consequence of something
being wanting, tc perceive their true relations to each
other, so as to place each of them in its right place
iu our intellectual system and to comprehend the
truth which they collectively contain,—in short, if
we fail to perceive their true theory,-theu we suffer
in this theoretic faculty the mental pain which the
sense of intellectual limitation and incapacity pro·
duces. On the other hand, ifwe bave rightly per-
ceived the facts and comprehended their theory, then
we feel the gratificaticn aud sense of power and
unrestrained energy which the unimpeded exercise of
our highest faculty produces, as well as that which is
occasioned by the addition made to our conception of
that system of truth which it is the highest pleasure
of the mind to contemplate.

“But perfect happiness is a contemplative ac-
tivity. For to the Gods the whole of life is blessed3
but to men only so far as a resemblance of such kind
of activity belongs to them.. But of other animals

none possess happiness (of this sort), since in no
respect do they participate iu contemplation.”-

Arist: Erotes. (Note F.)
