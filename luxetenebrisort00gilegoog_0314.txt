Oosmos—the reduction 01 its discordant parts to
order and harmony. But we are too near our work
to perceive its nature and meaning, and we know that
we shall not live to gether the fruits.

But the past we can see and judge 01, and in it ia
contained all we love most—the good, the noble, the
beautiful. Toit all thetis most deur goes before us
and becomes 8 part, or follows soon after. We have
been likened to nowers, who move on with their faces
turned towards what they are leaving3 andour hearts
are in that unknown land, “ where all things fair and
wisc descend.”

And underlying all the pheuomena, below, within, ’
around-upholding, quickeuiog, and comprehending
811 things, through time and change unchangeably
the same—is the Pcwer

“ Who wields the world with never-wearied love,
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above,’'

—the Great Universal spirit, by whom, andin whom
all things live, and to whom 811 things tend—the Lord
and Giver 01 light—of physical light, the source and
cause 01 811 physical goodness and beauty3 and of
mental light, the source and cause 01811 psychical

goodness and beauty 3- Ohastener, Sustainer‚ Ocn-

“The One remains, the many change and pass3
Hoeven's light for ever shines, Earth's shadowa dy ;
Life, like 8 dome 01 many-coloured gloss,

Staius the white radiance 01 Eternity,

Until death tramples it to fragments-Die,
