ence leads us to associate force with will—that being
the only source 01 force that our mental experience

’ furnishes us with-whenever we see evidence 01 force

put forth, we conceive the existence 01 some nell
from which it primarily emanated. From these

principles it follows that 011 the natural events which Δ

cannot be traoed either to our own action, or to that
01 any other psychical being embodied in a person,

as we are in the habit 01 saying, some spiritual ,
being. Furtber still: as we associate with will and
power, desire, thought, feeling, and all the other
η attributes of the human psyche, we invest these
spiritual conceptione 01 our mind with 011 these
attributes as well, and conceive the spiritual psyche
in our own image. The beings 01 our spiritual
world are, therefore, 01 necessity anthropomorpkic, or
human-like. They are made after our pattern, only
endowed with mightier wills and powers, and with
larger intelligences. And it is important to insist
, upon tbe fact, that the evidence upon which our
belief in such spiritual existence rests, is quite ‘as

j strong and indisputable as that for our belief in what

has been called psychical existence-as far at least
as that 01 otber persons is concerned; the only dif-
ference being that this latter is presented to us
personatcd in bodily forms, while spiritual existence
is, 00 far as we know, altogether unembodied, and,

in this sense, impersonal. The evidence for the ·

existence 01 other persons rests ultimately, as has
been shown, on our consciousness 01 our own personal
