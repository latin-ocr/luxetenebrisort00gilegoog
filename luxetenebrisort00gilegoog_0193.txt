t LXIII. The highest conception, then, presentat
any time in the mind, rules and bolds in thrall the
- beart, in psychical things as in physical. And, iu
botb cases, what sort of conception this will be
depends altogether, not on the individual himself in
the first instance, but on the directing influence of
circumstances. Until the attention bas been directed
to higher objecta every mind is occupied with the

low ones with which its history commenced, and ,

unless the psyche bas been rightly trained from the
first, orbas been induced to enlarge its news under
the influence of some force-privation, satiety, or
some startling event-its beart continues bent ou
such low object. But the elevating motives being
applied, the stature rises3 and, as it rises, the view
enlarges and the greater conceptions are formed.
The degree of force requisito to raise the psyche and
expand the mind depands on the strength of tbe
existing habit and on the natural docility and sus-
ceptibility. A mind free to move and quick of
apprehension readily responde wbeu appealed to;
but, unless au inveterately vicious condition exists,
every one cau be raised to bis utmost height by
proper influences rightly applied.

ξ LXIV. The desire of the beart, then, whether
with reference to physical things or to persons, is
to obtain the noblest and most elevating kind of

good of which the psyche bas formed a conception. '

Also in physical au‘d psychical matters equally, the

desire of the beart is not the right rule of the will.
