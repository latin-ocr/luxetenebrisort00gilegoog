cseertsin and maintain these right relations becomes
its chief care, and with this object it puts forth its
will-force, controls feeling, resists inclinatiou to at-
tracting objects, and practises habitually sels-respect3
’ taking care to enter on no course and commit
itself to no object until it is certain that it has
selected the hest that the circumstances present :—
in short, reversing the practice of the Epicurean, as
enunciated by Horace (Note J), it endeavours to
adapt itself to its circumstances, not to bend its
circumstances into harmony with its own feelings.
The characteristic of this will-force is that it
emanotes from the psyche itself, not from any of
the objects around it. Through its action on the
material organs of the hrain the psyche is enabled
to engage itself actively in the elaboration of its own
notions and conceptione, and in the adaptation of the
phenomens of sense to such.‘ It seems to be essen·
tislly a spiritual force, and not to he dependent on
Α any physical condition for its strength or wenkness.
It may be weak in the strongest hody3 and in the
very hour of death, when the hrain is feeble, and the
thinking and aoting powers are failing, and dissolution
is imminent, it may remein firm and constant to the
last. By putting forth this will-force the psyche has
the power, in healthy and normal conditions, to free
itself from all influences which have their root in
feeling, and viewing things hythe clear light of reason,
to judge of their respective values and to direct its
' conduct accordingly. The essenoe of the will-force
is, that it should he free from all admixture of feeling.
