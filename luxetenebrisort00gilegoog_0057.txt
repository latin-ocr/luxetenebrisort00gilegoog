It also is formed of the same materiale. The human
body is composed of matter which, originally inor·
ganic, has passed into and become orgauic in the
vegetable, and a portion of which sometimes has also
been further elaborated in the animal 3-in short, of Ι
food. The vegetoble is formed directly out of the
inorganic kingdom of matter ; the herbivorous
animal out 11 the vegetable3 the carnivorous animal
out 11 the herbivorous; and man, the omnivorous,
out of both the herbivorous animal and the vege·
table. He therefore, physically speaking, stands in

back to the organism the force which it had received

and thereby furnishes it with its dynamio supply;
while the remaining undecomposed portion affords
the material necessary for the maintenance of the
integrity of the organs through which the dynamio
element acts.
