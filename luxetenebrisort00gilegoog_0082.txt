all the consequences of their combinatione, which we
now learn from observation and experiment alone,
would also be as perfectly conceived and understood
by the mind, and would be attainable· by, and flow

perception, or reflection, by which it is obtained, is
named reasoning. This process, which, as far as
regards the mental attitude necessary for its proper
performance, has been already described (ξ ΧΙ.), has
been analysed and reduced to two parts, induction
and deduction. By the first of these processes
(described at length in t XXIV.) facts are grouped
together under principles or general facts, and these

r, again under principles yet wider and more general.

By the second process, vas each principle is arrived

all minor principles which it includes are deduced,

ciples on facts, and building these again into larger
and more comprehensive principles-covering fresh
principles and fresh groups of facts, the great
structure of truth daily grows.

The process of classitication and of reasoning—inductive and
deductiva-maybe illustrated invarious ways. Thus truth may
