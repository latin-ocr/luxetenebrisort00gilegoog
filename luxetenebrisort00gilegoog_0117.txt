That the mind possessos faculties such as have been
described above, is indisputable 3 it is a fact of con·
sciousness. That such faculties are exercised through
the medium of physica] instruments is in accordance
with all physiological and pathological experience
which concur in teaching that all the facts of con-
'sciousness are dependent for their manifestation on
physical organisation. Through what structures of
the brain, however, these functions are performed
is not as yet agreed upon. With respect to the first
set of instruments alluded to above—the ideo-motor
as they may be called—nothing whatever is positively
known. The theatre in which they operate-the
