which may be called catenat-as their field of
action is in the· outside world, by operating on
the things of which they produce changes in the
sensory ganglia and corresponding changes in the
phencmena of sense within the sphera of conscious·
ness. By their means the outer eye is directed to
surrounding material objecta, and these objecta arc
grasped, modified and re·arranged by the bodily
murales, so as to bring them into conformity with
the ideas and notions that exist in the mind. Thus
the ultimate effect of the action of both of these sets
of organs is to produce changes in cerebral ganglia,
and, through them, in the phencmena of conscious·
ness z—in the sensory ganglia and phencmena of
sense, by the action of the external set3 in the
intellectual ganglia and phenomena of thought, by
that of the inner set3 but they differ in this:
whereas the first or interna] set act direotly on the
intellectual ganglia, and the operation is entirelya
cerebral one3 the primary action of the second or
externa] set is on the musculo-motor ganglia which

give rise to the bodily incrementa, and between these
ganglia and the sensory in which the final changes
occur, the nervas, muscles, and other organs of the
molory apparatus of the body are interposed‚ as well
as the material things of the outer world on which
these operate.
