’ existence3 and the evidence sor spiritual existence
rests also on 'the same foundation.

ξ LXXIX. Our belief in spiritual existence, then, is
deduced from our notione of the Oosmos. Every event
which cannot be traced either to our own actions, or to
the action of some other being embodied in a bodily
form, is referred ultimately to it. And the form
which such conception takes in our minds is dependent
on, and varies with, our notions of the Cosmos. Thus
the uninformed savage, whose knowledge is limited
to a few isolated facts, when he sees an objectos an
unusual and mysterious character, or possessing
remarkable qualities, conceives such to be animated
or possessed bya distinct spiritual being. Hence
Fetere-worship. As knowledge advanced, and things
became grouped together iu men's minds in
classes, to each of these classes or groups of things
a distinct deity or ruler was assigned3 and so arose
that higher conceptiones the spiritual which is called
polytlrcism. And this system of deities became more
elaborate and highly organised with the growth of
knowledge, and the increasing complexity of notions
about things. The older deities were those cf the
physica] world—of the air, earth, water, fire, light,
and the heavenly bodies. Then the attributes of the
human mind became spiritualised. The god of the
sun became also the god of knowledge or mental
light 3 the pleasures and appetites, the passione,
wisdom, purity or chastity-—all had their divinities.
There were Furies, Graces, Muses, and thus the
system grew, expanding and refining with the growth

and culture of the human mind-a beautiful system,
