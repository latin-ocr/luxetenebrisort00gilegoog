knowledge, to collect and conwey it by means of

apparatus—horrowed lights and other contriwauces—
into regions which are hidden from superficial vision
-into the interior of the earth, the minute structure
of things, the human physical beart and hrain—and
so penetrate into the depths of the physical Oosmos,
and bring to view its secret facts 3 so we have it

obtain glimpses of truths deeper still 3 and thus,
extracting truth from its well, transcend from the
world of sense to that of thought, and arrivs at regions
which are directly revealed tono sense. And this
mental light further agrees with the physical in that
its progress is gradual. At first it is distributed
in scant measure, and things are perceiyed superfi-
cially only and confusedly3 but, as it advances, they
become more distinct, the light seems to penetrate,
and we perceive the things thoroughly3 and not only
the things themselves, but their relations to other
things and the grounds on which they rest. They

And it follows from this gradual progress of the
light, that the most simple things are first understood,
and afterwards the more complex, of which these form
a part. For when the common clement hasbeen
