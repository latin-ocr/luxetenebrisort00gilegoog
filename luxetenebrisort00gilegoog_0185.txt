disagreeahly affected accordingly.

Again, the sentiments and feelings they express-⁴
their likes and dislikes—coincide with, or differ from,

own, and feeling that we should be inexcusable if,

with our conceptione, we exhibited their conduct or ,

expressed the sentiments we condemn in them, wo
hold them also inexcusable: and bitterness is added
to the disagreement. According, then, to the liheness
or unlikeness between our views is our intercourse with
each other agreeable or disagreeable—apart from con-
siderations of material interests. When likcaescexists
we like each other, and give and receive from cachother
sympathy. When there is calikcaess we diclike each
other, and there is mutual antipathy. Emotion is
the outcome of excited feelings-the vent by which
it relieves itself. All feeling, whether pleasurable
or painful, seclis this relief. Sympathy, b‘y rein·
