reducing our notione of au material action to the
simple one of imperceptihle molecules of matter in
various phases of motion. Such conditions can
neither he exhibited to sense nor conceived in
thought as identical with the phenomena which are
presented to us in consciousness. The two classes of
things are fundamentally distinct, and will not
admit of comparison.

The conclusion that the seat of the physical
phenomena perceived in consciousness is the mind,
not the outside material world, may be demonstrated
in another way. The perceived object must be
situated either in the outside material world—be, in
fact, the actual material thing ; or within the
material body—in the organ of sense or its ganglion3
or it must be in the mind itself. That it is not the
actual material thing has been shown already3 for it
is sometimes present when this is absent, and
sometimes absent when this is present3 and our
reason tells us that things of which this can be said,
must be distinct from each other. ,Neither is it
situated within the body3 for this is contradicted by
the direct testimony oi consciousness, which represents
it as differently placed with regard to the body. It
follows that both it and the body, as perceived in
consciousness, are situated in the mind—are mental
phenomena3 and the facts justify the conclusion that
such phenomena have as their proximate cause
cerebral change, and usually, as their remote cause,
outside material fact.

And if the physical perceptions are phenomena of
mind, it follows from a precisely similar line of
