tures through the oyem of which the reflex and
apparently unconscious action takes place between
the impressed psyche and the impressing ideas by
which such ideas are chaped into conceptions; aud
others as well, through which the psyche consciously,
whether impelled by feeling or guided by deliberation
and reason, acts on its thoughts, and, through the
.muscles and nerves of the body, on the objects of sense.
And there is reason to hope that the cerebral phy,
siologist, the mental side of the problern being
given, will be thereby furnished with the clue to
the physicalside, and, kuowing better what to look
for, will by and by discover such structures and ba
able to assign to each its proper function3 audeo
the function of the brain will be at last understood.
And we may further hope that, through understanding
the structure aud functione of the brein-orgaus, he
will arrive at a knowledge of the conditions necessary
to their perfect action, aud learn how, by supplying
such conditions, to preserve cerebral health and pre·
vent cerebral and—its consequence—mental disease.
Audin like manner, the pathologist, applying such
knowledge to his department, will be enabled from
the symptoms to deduce the structure that is dia·
-0rdered‚ and the wrong conditions that have iuduued
it3 and so learn, by supplying the right conditions
and correcting influences, as far as possible to restore
health
